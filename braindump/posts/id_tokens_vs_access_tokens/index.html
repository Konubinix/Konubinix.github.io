<p><a href="/braindump/posts/openid_connect/">OIDC</a> comes with the notion of <a href="/braindump/posts/openid_connect/#6796313b-7141-4013-848f-bc08edd02472">id token</a>. This is a <a href="/braindump/posts/json_web_tokens/">JWT formatted token</a>, and
because a lot of <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#ead7dfac-e39a-4262-8066-a9e594d1b8a3">authorization server</a>s format the <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#26052c2d-ac4a-4637-9122-704d51585dc8">access tokens</a> also using JWT,
people tend to confuse both<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This leads to people using id tokens as access token interchangeably and other
people shouting that this is something &ldquo;YOU MUST NEVER DO!&rdquo; without much
argumentation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to bring some nuance in here.</p>
<h2 id="b1aca54b-7957-434a-a973-8d6c96362872">usage made by some well known players</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s note that some well known tools use the id token to get access to
first party data<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. So we might be puzzled that even big actors don&rsquo;t
follow those recommendations.</p>
<p>As stated in the documentation of google, there are situations where
authentication is enough. For those, using an id token is enough<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. They
appreciate its ease of use but they emphasize of course the need for validating
it<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This is by no mean an argument in favor of using id token in place of access
token, but it is a hint that the question might be broader than &ldquo;using id
token or access token&rdquo;. It might rather be more like this: in a particular
situation, can I send an id token? can I send an access token?</p>
<p>And, most of all, it asks whether we are falling into the <a href="/braindump/posts/black_or_white_fallacy/">black or white
fallacy</a> and suppose being able to implement a security model with access token
would mean that we cannot implement it with an id token.</p>
<h2 id="70a3177c-8ed3-4c6f-a84d-825963bba266"><a href="/braindump/posts/deontologie/">deontological</a> point of view vs <a href="/braindump/posts/pragmatisme/">pragmatical</a> point of view</h2>
<p>Often, we see that &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT SEND AN ID TOKEN AS AUTHORIZATION TO THE
API&rdquo;<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> because it is not meant for that. But alone, this does not weight
much on the decision. If you face a case where it makes sense to do that,
you&rsquo;d better understand why not doing that and not just listen to <a href="/braindump/posts/method_priest/">method
priests</a>.</p>
<p>When looking for articles about access token vs id tokens, it seems to me that
there are a lot of them trying to prevent the so-called &ldquo;misuses&rdquo; of id-token
but with only superficial understanding of the threats model. They look like
they <a href="/braindump/posts/begging_the_question/">beg the question</a>. They start with the <a href="/braindump/posts/belief_system/">belief</a> that &ldquo;you shall not send an
id token&rdquo; and try to <a href="/braindump/posts/rationalisation/">rationalize</a> this afterwards.</p>
<p>This leads to arguments that look very poor and often not appropriate.</p>
<p>For instance, some forgot about the <a href="/braindump/posts/json_web_tokens/#a2b1404d-5b65-4822-b4f1-e049a751072b">authorized party claim</a><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and get into
the <a href="/braindump/posts/slippery_slope/">slippery slope</a> of thinking other kinds of misuses<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> that are not
relevant with the question at hand. For instance, not explicitly asking for the
user consent totally makes sense in the <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#02c86448-ca36-4995-b93e-fec4967b3b9c">first-party</a> scenario.</p>
<p>It is even forgotten that permissions can take a lot of forms and that access
tokens are only one way to grant them<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the end, those argument look like this: &ldquo;use only access token&rdquo;, because
&ldquo;this is not meant to be used like that&rdquo; or &ldquo;it can lead to unauthorized
access to resources&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, some security risks are valid both id tokens and access token, making
them irrelevant in the decision of using one or the other<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="ab1ec2b0-d2ca-405d-a9c7-d2b3b8245382"><a href="/braindump/posts/audience_claim/">audience</a>s: client vs resource server</h2>
<p>The JWT payload of the ID Token is quite explicit, this is meant to be
consumed by the client (called the <a href="/braindump/posts/relying_party/">relying party</a> in <a href="/braindump/posts/openid_connect/">OIDC</a>) while the access
token is meant to reach the <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#72564685-ad13-4af1-8a9a-8230b967a36b">resource server</a><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. When the later
is <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#eec4cf73-015a-4574-beb5-f6c95445dfa7">self-encoded</a>, its audience claim makes this even more explicit.</p>
<p>In some cases, where you have a SPA that consumes some resources from your
server, the only think you need is a proof of authentication to get access to
the resources of the user. When using an <a href="/braindump/posts/identity_provider/">Identity Provider</a>, you define an
application and get a meaningless string as client id like
&ldquo;3faa352f-a50e-46a0-a286-b6a001f0fed5.apps.googleusercontent.com&rdquo;. Deciding
that the server and the frontend ARE the client and that therefore
&ldquo;3faa352f-a50e-46a0-a286-b6a001f0fed5.apps.googleusercontent.com&rdquo; refers to
both makes sense. Therefore, the argument about the audience appears to only
become a <a href="/braindump/posts/debat_semantique/">semantic debate</a> more than anything else.</p>
<h2 id="adb72020-20c1-49ac-9ad4-040d1354addb">usage: <a href="/braindump/posts/authentication/">authentication</a> vs <a href="/braindump/posts/authorization/">authorization</a></h2>
<p>When receiving an id token, you have a proof that a user authenticated, but
that says nothing about whether or not this user has access to what<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. On the
contrary, an access token says nothing about the user, but indicates a right
to access some resources<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Both may be related, as sometimes, some claims about
the user are needed to perform authorization decisions.</p>
<p>Therefore, both authentication and authorization are needed in an
authorization flow<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Actually, it seems like <a href="/braindump/posts/authentication_vs_identification_vs_authorization/">authentication and authorization</a> overlap a bit in
several real life use cases. To me, this is because is those use cases, the
client and the resource server come from the same organisation, making it a
<a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#02c86448-ca36-4995-b93e-fec4967b3b9c">first party client</a>. In that case, a proof of <a href="/braindump/posts/authentication/">authentication</a> may be the only
needed information to grant access to resources<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. In fact, even in
the third party scenario, as long as the resource server knows which client gets
access to what resources, the id token, conveying the information about a user
AND an <a href="/braindump/posts/json_web_tokens/#a2b1404d-5b65-4822-b4f1-e049a751072b">authorized third party</a>, is enough to discriminate what resources to grant
access to and what to deny access.</p>
<p>Authorization, as part of oauth2, comes with some extra RFCs to allow more
secure means of communication, called <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#85716a8f-a45b-4829-81f3-031544a931a9">sender constraints</a>. This makes sense in
the third-party case, because the access token will be shared with some
systems out of the scope of the system dealing with the authorization.</p>
<p>An article of auth0 explains that even though in the first-party scenario,
sending an id token might be enough<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>, the sender constraints make using
an access token better suited, security wise<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>They insist that this decision of sending an id token or an access token only
makes sense in the first-party scenario. In the third party scenario, there is
no question that only an access token makes sense<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. This can be nuanced
as well, because as long as your authorization server knows the client and
checks that the received id token was issued explicitly to this client (using
the <a href="/braindump/posts/json_web_tokens/#a2b1404d-5b65-4822-b4f1-e049a751072b">azp Claim</a>), then there is no reason to refuse this client access to the
resources that you know it should get access to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their argument is based on a <a href="/braindump/posts/slippery_slope/">slippery slope</a>, where they
assume that you make no verification at all about the audience<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, while
an ID Token issued only for a third party client for which we know the kind of
authorization we need, we can check the <a href="/braindump/posts/json_web_tokens/#a2b1404d-5b65-4822-b4f1-e049a751072b">azp Claim</a> and the <a href="/braindump/posts/audience_claim/">audience claim</a>.</p>
<p>This asks the question whether the other arguments of the article were also
tainted to persuade not to send an id token instead of looking at the
situation neutrally.</p>
<h2 id="e9520212-2d63-4003-b625-49fba874d839">architecture arguments</h2>
<p>One critic against using the ID token is that they are passed though the
<a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#5d9fcc89-c31e-43ed-a53f-b548eb688999">bearer token</a> transport that was intended in oauth2, for access
tokens<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. To my mind, this is partially valid, as using stuff like an
access token might lead to difficulties to explain the model afterwards, but by
no means using the &ldquo;Bearer &quot; keyword should provide an security issues, if the
content is appropriately processed.</p>
<p>One might argue as well (yet I did not actually read that) that a well
organised architecture will give less room for bugs involving security. If the
authorization server is responsible for providing authorization and the
resource server is simply reading the authorization claims without making more
clever thinking, like filtering based on the authorized third parties and user
identity, we may reduce the possibility of getting through its security. I&rsquo;m
not totally convinced, as you have to configure the resource server anyway to
map some claims to some resources, so using the &ldquo;azp&rdquo; and &ldquo;sub&rdquo; or using
&ldquo;foo&rdquo;, &ldquo;bar&rdquo; look identical to me, security wise.</p>
<h2 id="1f38be3b-cd94-4744-b15f-ea5e139c38d3">final note, is that only a <a href="/braindump/posts/debat_semantique/">semantic debate</a>?</h2>
<p>I could read arguments stating that if the <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#72564685-ad13-4af1-8a9a-8230b967a36b">resource server</a> needs some
information about the user to tackle authorisation, one can provide the
content of the id token, but should make it part of the payload of the access
token<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. They insist on the need to follow the standards to avoid falling
into subtle traps that experts did not analyse, because we got into uncharted
territory<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it strikes me that − <a href="/braindump/posts/ceteris_paribus/">ceteris paribus</a> − deciding whether a
particular program should be called a <a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#72564685-ad13-4af1-8a9a-8230b967a36b">resource server</a> or part of an
<a href="/braindump/posts/oauth_2_0/#ead7dfac-e39a-4262-8066-a9e594d1b8a3">authorization server</a> (getting an identity from an <a href="/braindump/posts/identity_provider/">Identity Provider</a> for
instance) will change the perspective of whether an id token or an access
token is suited in a particular situation<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>That would mean that the debate could be not about using such or such
artifact, but being very clear about the function of the parts of one&rsquo;s
architecture.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that most of those discussions about using an id token or
an access token <a href="/braindump/posts/red_herring/">miss the point</a>, and are <a href="/braindump/posts/substitution_de_question/">question substitution</a> for &ldquo;what are
you trying to achieve and how are you going to use oauth2 and oidc to achieve
it?&rdquo;</p>

explicitly providing a flow for doing so.</p>

following are common situations where you might send ID tokens to your server:&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>One thing that makes ID tokens useful is that fact that you can pass them around
different components of your app. These components can use an ID token as a
lightweight authentication mechanism authenticating the app and the user. But
before you can use the information in the ID token or rely on it as an assertion
that the user has authenticated, you must validate it</p>

<p>Possession of the access token is not proof of authentication because access
tokens can be acquired in multiple ways. Consider refresh tokens, which a client
can exchange for another access token when the original is invalidated. This
process occurs automatically between machines and does not involve the human
user in any way, so the access token is not a proxy for authentication. ID
tokens can only be obtained when the human user explicitly gives a client access
to whatever information it requires. In other words, the user must go through
the process of “Sign[ing] in with Google,” which only the account holder is
capable of doing,assuming credentials have not been compromised</p>
