<p>I have heard people raise a <a href="/braindump/posts/debat_semantique/">semantic debate</a> where authenticating several times
using the same nature of authentication may be called MFA. For instance, a
colleague called 2FA password authenticating twice from two distinct
<a href="/braindump/posts/identity_provider/">Identity Provider</a>s (hence two methods about &ldquo;something you know&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Per also claimed that whatever the nature, as long as the authenticating
services asks for N pieces of evidence, then it becomes NFA.</p>
<p>Per main argument was that the introduction of the wikipedia page says so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors)</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>may require more than one factor—multi-factor authentication, or two-factor
authentication in cases where exactly two pieces of evidence are to be supplied</p>
<p>&mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, this articles appears to say that a factor is a piece of evidence, not
a TYPE of piece of evidence. It suggests that the TYPEs may only be good
practices.</p>
<p>Puzzled by the assertion of my colleague, I dug a little deeper. I even
followed the wikipedia citations :-).</p>
<p>I realized that a lot of definitions lack clarity, defining a factor as a
piece of evidence or simply not defining it at all<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But even more
clarified that it is about the TYPE of the piece of evidence<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and not
about the number of pieces. Some did even provide examples of what is NOT
MFA<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, like asking two passwords.</p>
<p>I did not find a &ldquo;first definition&rdquo; that would end the debate. It appear to be
first used in a patent, so I probably never (pay to) read this definition.</p>
<p>Yet, I <a href="/braindump/posts/decide_de_croire/">decided to believe</a> that this is only bad phrasing and that there is a
huge consensus to say that a factor is a TYPE of authentication. Even sites
that provide poor definition still appear to convey this idea. And I did not
find any not site claiming that such things as password and question phrase
could be named 2FA. It appears to be difficult to spend some time looking for
a definition at eventually believing this.</p>
<p>Actually, even the sources (I did not look at all of them though) of the
wikipedia page are about TYPES of evidence.</p>
<p>For example, the source of the previous citation says:</p>
<p>I understand that this might undergo the <a href="/braindump/posts/naming_things_tragedy/">naming things tragedy</a>. Yet the
consensus appear to be very strong and I guess people like my colleague did
not read much nor think much about it. Even the name should tell, because if
factors where just pieces of evidences, <a href="/braindump/posts/multi_authentication/">Multi Authentication</a> would summarize
it well.</p>
<p>In the end I encourage people to try to go beyond the wording and discuss what
they are trying to achieve in term of security before entering an unwanted
<a href="/braindump/posts/debat_semantique/">semantic debate</a>. For instance, asking for a <a href="/braindump/posts/time_based_one_time_password/">TOTP</a> and a <a href="/braindump/posts/personal_security_device/">personal security
device</a> may well be a very good design in some cases, whatever we decide to
call it 1FA or 2FA.</p>
