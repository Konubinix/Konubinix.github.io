<p>communication must be stateless in nature, as in the client-stateless-server
(CSS) style of Section 3.4.3 (Figure 5-3), such that each request from client to
server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request,
and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is
therefore kept entirely on the client.</p>

<p>Visibility is improved because a monitoring system does not have to look beyond
a single request datum in order to determine the full nature of the
request. Reliability is improved because it eases the task of recovering from
partial failures [133]. Scalability is improved because not having to store
state between requests allows the server component to quickly free resources,
and further simplifies implementation because the server doesn&rsquo;t have to manage
resource usage across requests.</p>

<p>REST concentrates all of the control state into the representations received in response to interactions. The goal is to improve server scalability by eliminating any need for the server to maintain an awareness of the client state beyond the current request. An application&rsquo;s state is therefore defined by its pending requests, the topology of connected components (some of which may be filtering buffered data), the active requests on those connectors, the data flow of representations in response to those requests, and the processing of those representations as they are received by the user agent.</p>

<p>Since REST-based architectures communicate primarily through the transfer of representations of resources, latency can be impacted by both the design of the communication protocols and the design of the representation data formats.

<p>Roy: I talk about it because the initial reaction to using REST for
machine-to-machine interaction is almost always of the form &ldquo;we don’t see a
reason to bother with hypermedia — it just slows down the interactions, as
opposed to the client knowing directly what to send.&rdquo; The rationale behind
decoupling for evolvability is simply not apparent to developers who think they
are working towards a modest goal, like &ldquo;works next week&rdquo; or &ldquo;we’ll fix it in
the next release&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If developers can conceive of their systems being used for a much longer time,
then we can escape their own preconceptions about how it will need to change
over time. We can then work back from decades to years (how long until you don’t
know your users?) or even months (how long until you’ve lost control over client
deployment?).</p>

<p>hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot; is a REST constraint. Not an

baked into their design at deployment. Controls have to be learned on the
