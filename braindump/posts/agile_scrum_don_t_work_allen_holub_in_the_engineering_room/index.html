<h2 id="5681011f-dfa1-4f2e-90c8-dccec5a64917">what I understand of <a href="/braindump/posts/allen_holub/">Allen Holub</a>&rsquo;s opinion</h2>
<p>In this episode of the <a href="/braindump/posts/continuous_delivery_podcast/">continuous delivery podcast</a>, <a href="/braindump/posts/allen_holub/">Allen Holub</a> gives
his opinion about the current practices of <a href="/braindump/posts/agile_methods/">agile methods</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a>.</p>
<p>He regrets that the <a href="/braindump/posts/vernacular_language/">ordinary use</a> of agile has become meaningless and people tend
to thrive for getting out of agile by describing some ideal that actually is the
definition of agile (according to him).</p>
<p>They regret also that <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a> and derived methods like SAFE<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> have become dump
stuff made to be sold to people that are not willing to do agile but still want
to have some kind of certification.</p>
<p><a href="/braindump/posts/allen_holub/">Allen Holub</a> indicates that the concepts of scrum are meaningless and
oftentimes harmful, like the notion of accountability that entails a violent
wording.</p>
<p>He criticizes the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_priest/">scrum priest</a> state of mind<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. He is fed up with the fact people
defend the <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#inspection">inspection</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#adaptation">adaptation</a> of <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a> without realizing that those
actually are already part of agile. Like if scrum had given something new, while
it is some rebranding of agile with loss of meaning. In his opinion, this became
like this when money has been involved.</p>
<p>He regrets that people are <a href="/braindump/posts/estimation_priests/">estimation priests</a> and emphasizes the fact that
we won&rsquo;t know how to estimate a things prior to having some experience about the
things.</p>
<p>He even says that scrum is contradictory when dealing with estimation and
pretending being based on <a href="/braindump/posts/lean/">lean</a>. If you repeatedly try something and repeatedly
find out that it does not work, you should stop trying it.</p>
<p>In companies he came as a coach, they hired him to make better estimation. When
he asks them why, they answer that they won&rsquo;t spend a lot of money for a project
unless they know how much time it will take. He then teaches them that this is
the wrong question as well as how to make iteration and repeatedly adding
value. When they ask him what is this wonderful method, he says it is <a href="/braindump/posts/agile_methods/">agile</a>. But
the <a href="/braindump/posts/vernacular_language/">ordinary use</a> of agile was so strong that they did not even believe him.</p>
<p>He is strongly against trying to define metrics, because, according to him, they
tend to fall into the hands of the managers and therefore become victim of the
<a href="/braindump/posts/loi_de_goodhart/">Goodhart&rsquo;s law</a>.</p>
<p>Companies tend to confuse managers with leaders. They should have more leaders
and less managers.</p>
<p>Then, even though scrum did a lot of harm to agile communities in general, the
<a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum guide</a> only defined meaningless meetings in an empty method that per se are
not harmful. It is what people made of it that was harmful.</p>
<p>They also discuss the <a href="/braindump/posts/slacker_fallacy/">slacker fallacy</a> and the fact in performance reviews people
are considered the cause of the issues. This contradicts the idea of <a href="/braindump/posts/agile_methods/">agile
methods</a> that needs empowered people (also, see <a href="/braindump/posts/how_to_future_proof_your_business_in_a_fast_changing_world_a_chat_with_brian_robertson/#921ec192-4c24-4b04-a2a5-24c18441061e">often the system is perfectly
designed to generate the result it did</a>).</p>
<p>More generally, he thrive for leaving more room for intuitions. For instance, he
deplores the fact HR hires people without considering future coworkers&rsquo; opinion.</p>
<p>Also, he thinks that informatics does not needs solid mathematical knowledge but
rather solid social and psychological knowledge<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="60a966ab-38f3-4890-b89c-cf457f4631e9">My opinion</h2>
<p>To me, he describes something very similar to the <a href="/braindump/posts/tragedie_de_la_definition_d_une_methode/">tragédie de la définition d&rsquo;un
méthode</a>. From the initial definition to the ordinary use that converges after a
long chain of <a href="/braindump/posts/theorie_causale_de_la_reference/">references</a>, there are several differences. Then people tend to
<a href="/braindump/posts/rationalisation/">rationalize</a> their opinion using the initial text, becoming <a href="/braindump/posts/method_priest/">method priest</a>s.</p>
<p>I cannot tell whether I agree or not about whether scrum is a good method or not
because, as <a href="/braindump/posts/allen_holub/">Allen Holub</a> says, people tend to use the word scrum to do other
things that what is described into the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum guide</a>. Therefore, it would need
many experiences of scrum by the book to have a sensible opinion about whether
it is useful or not.</p>
<p>Whether he is right or wrong, it looks to me like he developed some kind of
aversion to some words, like accountability, metric, scrum. I agree that those
words are very <a href="/braindump/posts/loaded_language/">loaded</a>, but in some sense he stopped the <a href="/braindump/posts/gricean_pragmatics/#72c37d30-0027-43e9-afc9-017af9c24adc">game of communication</a>
there and apparently stopped trying to understand what could be good in those
notion, because of his bad experiences.</p>
<p>For instance, it sounds like he despises the notion of metric, even when it may
be used to describe exactly what he is suggesting: asking around and gathering
answers. I think he means that people tend to blindly trust numbers and formulas
and make then suddenly become <a href="/braindump/posts/loi_de_goodhart/">objectives</a>, rather that <a href="/braindump/posts/education_du_systeme_1/">educating the system
1</a>. Also, it looks similar to the <a href="/braindump/posts/decision_hygiene/">decision hygiene</a> of <a href="/braindump/posts/beyond_bias_with_olivier_sibony/#39c32d10-9079-4524-8f85-a48ceabcf270">don&rsquo;t use scales when
measuring something</a>. Yet, the apparently systematic reject of the word itself,
while a good <a href="/braindump/posts/heuristique/">heuristic</a> is to me the sign of a <a href="/braindump/posts/polarization/">polarization</a>, due to the too many
bad experiences, and making his arguments about this particular subject
doubtful.</p>

<p>However, he defends some of his arguments citing the <a href="/braindump/posts/agile_methods/">agile manifesto</a>,
making him look like a kind of « agile priest_». To me, he might well be victim

<p>to me, he falls here into the <a href="/braindump/posts/curse_of_knowledge/">curse of knowledge</a>.
