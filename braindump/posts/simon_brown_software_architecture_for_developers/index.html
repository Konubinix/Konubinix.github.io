<p><a href="/braindump/posts/simon_brown/">Simon Brown</a>, <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/">software architecture</a>, <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/#a05d2abd-e646-41c0-8295-befca58372de">C4 model for visualising software architecture</a></p>
<p>He says that we first had <a href="/braindump/posts/waterfall/">waterfall</a> models and its big upfront design and when
<a href="/braindump/posts/agile_methods/">agile methods</a> came, people confusingly understood that it told that we should
not make any upfront design at all.</p>
<p>He uses the citation <a href="/braindump/posts/big_design_up_front_is_dumb_but_doing_no_design_up_front_is_even_dumber/">big design up front is dumb, but doing no design up front is even dumber</a>.</p>
<p>He says that the amount of upfront design to do is «just enough». You should
have just enough to get you started. Some goal, a vision to get to.</p>
<p>In the guitar analogy to explain the <a href="/braindump/posts/evolutionary_architecture/">evolutionary architecture</a>, <a href="/braindump/posts/emergent_design/">emergent design</a>, I believe it
gives a wrong idea of what it would look like. I believe that at first, you
don&rsquo;t even have a clear idea that you need strings or even something to make
sound. This also comes clearer when the project moves forward. This is part of
thinking in the problem space, you realize along the way that you got it all
wrong and it is better to <a href="/braindump/posts/fail_early/">fail early</a> rather than <a href="/braindump/posts/erreur_est_humaine/">keeping pushing in the wrong
direction</a>.</p>
<p>For him, we need to engage in the <a href="/braindump/posts/problem_space/">problem space</a> to create a <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/">software
architecture</a>. The two question you should ask are &ldquo;is that what we are going
to build&rdquo; and &ldquo;is that going to work&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cites <a href="/braindump/posts/important_decisions_as_measured_by_the_cost_of_change/">important decisions, as measured by the cost of change</a>, indicating that
there is no string threshold between significant and not significant.</p>
<p>Enough up front design to create a good starting point and direction.</p>
<p>It is said that we need a common view of the architecture or else we get a <a href="/braindump/posts/big_ball_of_mud/">big
ball of mud</a>. This document is not necessarily dealt with by a single person,
but it is dealt with by a role. The fact that some people occasionally lead this
document is likely a symptom of the <a href="/braindump/posts/super_hero_antipattern/">super hero antipattern</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to think about software architecture.</p>
<p>He describes the solution <a href="/braindump/posts/application_design_and_straw_man_fallacy/">architect antipattern</a> that just give people a document
to implement without being involved in the process of implementing it, like a
relay sport. When he asks how the guy know that the solution is implementable,
the guy does not know how to answer and fall back invoking an &ldquo;implementation
detail&rdquo;. <a href="/braindump/posts/how_to_future_proof_your_business_in_a_fast_changing_world_a_chat_with_brian_robertson/#921ec192-4c24-4b04-a2a5-24c18441061e">often the system is perfectly designed to generate the result it did</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/#3955cfdf-25bf-4c70-822f-ad2ec82b8641">software architect</a> is a <a href="/braindump/posts/technical_lead/">technical lead</a> whose most difficult task is dealing
with other people (<a href="/braindump/posts/soft_skills/">soft skills</a>). It is about coding, collaboration and coaching.</p>
<p>It as also a <a href="/braindump/posts/master_builder/">master builder</a>, someone with a lot of experience that will be
recognised for per knowledge by per peers, rather than simply be put their by a
management that wants to justify a pay raise (<a href="/braindump/posts/principe_de_peter/">principe de Peter</a>).</p>
<p>A <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/#3955cfdf-25bf-4c70-822f-ad2ec82b8641">software architect</a> is a guy that works like the other developers, only that
per has been recognised to have experience.</p>
<p>For him, the <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/">software architecture</a> should not use complex notation, like <a href="/braindump/posts/uml/">uml</a>,
but it should not be totally free (like using a <a href="/braindump/posts/whiteboard/">whiteboard</a>). It should provide
some constraints but still leave room for creative thinking.</p>
<p>Better focus of abstraction rather than notation, this is why he created the <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/#a05d2abd-e646-41c0-8295-befca58372de">C4
model for visualising software architecture</a>.</p>
<p>To him, we should keep our <a href="/braindump/posts/freedom_to_make_mistakes/">freedom to make mistakes</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/continuous_improvement/">continuous improvement</a>.</p>
