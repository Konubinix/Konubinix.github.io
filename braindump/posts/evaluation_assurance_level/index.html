<blockquote>
<p>Assurance levels</p>
<p>EAL1: Functionally Tested</p>
<p>EAL1 is applicable where some confidence in correct operation is required, but
the threats to security are not viewed as serious. It will be of value where
independent assurance is required to support the contention that due care has
been exercised with respect to the protection of personal or similar
information. EAL1 provides an evaluation of the TOE (Target of Evaluation) as
made available to the customer, including independent testing against a
specification, and an examination of the guidance documentation provided. It is
intended that an EAL1 evaluation could be successfully conducted without
assistance from the developer of the TOE, and for minimal cost. An evaluation at
this level should provide evidence that the TOE functions in a manner consistent
with its documentation, and that it provides useful protection against
identified threats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EAL2: Structurally Tested</p>
<p>EAL2 requires the cooperation of the developer in terms of the delivery of
design information and test results, but should not demand more effort on the
part of the developer than is consistent with good commercial practice. As such
it should not require a substantially increased investment of cost or time. EAL2
is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require
a low to moderate level of independently assured security in the absence of
ready availability of the complete development record. Such a situation may
arise when securing legacy systems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EAL3: Methodically Tested and Checked</p>
<p>EAL3 permits a conscientious developer to gain maximum assurance from positive
security engineering at the design stage without substantial alteration of
existing sound development practices. EAL3 is applicable in those circumstances
where developers or users require a moderate level of independently assured
security, and require a thorough investigation of the TOE and its development
without substantial re-engineering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EAL4: Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed</p>
<p>EAL4 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security
engineering based on good commercial development practices which, though
rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other
resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically
feasible to retrofit to an existing product line. EAL4 is therefore applicable
in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate to high
level of independently assured security in conventional commodity TOEs and are
prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs.</p>
<p>Commercial operating systems that provide conventional, user-based security
features are typically evaluated at EAL4. Examples of such operating systems are
AIX,[1] HP-UX,[1] Oracle Linux, NetWare, Solaris,[1] SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server 9,[1][2] SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10,[3] Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5,[4][5] Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows 2003,[1][6] Windows XP,[1][6]
Windows Vista,[7][8] Windows 7,[1][9] Windows Server 2008 R2,[1][9] macOS Mojave
10.14 Catalina 10.15, z/OS version 2.1 and z/VM version 6.3.[1]</p>
<p>Operating systems that provide multilevel security are evaluated at a minimum of
EAL4. Examples include Trusted Solaris, Solaris 10 Release 11/06 Trusted
Extensions,[10] an early version of the XTS-400, VMware ESXi version 4.1,[11]
3.5, 4.0, AIX 4.3, AIX 5L, AIX 6, AIX7, Red Hat 6.2 &amp; SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server 11 (EAL 4+). vSphere 5.5 Update 2 did not achieve EAL4+ level it was an
EAL2+ and certified on June 30, 2015.</p>

<p>EAL5: Semiformally Designed and Tested</p>
<p>EAL5 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from security engineering
based upon rigorous commercial development practices supported by moderate
application of specialist security engineering techniques. Such a TOE will
probably be designed and developed with the intent of achieving EAL5
assurance. It is likely that the additional costs attributable to the EAL5
requirements, relative to rigorous development without the application of
specialized techniques, will not be large. EAL5 is therefore applicable in those
circumstances where developers or users require a high level of independently
assured security in a planned development and require a rigorous development
approach without incurring unreasonable costs attributable to specialist
security engineering techniques.</p>
<p>Numerous smart card devices have been evaluated at EAL5, as have multilevel
secure devices such as the Tenix Interactive Link. XTS-400 (STOP 6) is a
general-purpose operating system which has been evaluated at EAL5 augmented.</p>
<p>LPAR on IBM System z is EAL5 Certified.[12]</p>

<p>EAL6: Semiformally Verified Design and Tested</p>
<p>EAL6 permits developers to gain high assurance from application of security
engineering techniques to a rigorous development environment in order to produce
a premium TOE for protecting high-value assets against significant risks. EAL6
is therefore applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in
high risk situations where the value of the protected assets justifies the
additional costs.</p>
<p>Green Hills Software&rsquo;s INTEGRITY-178B RTOS has been certified to EAL6
augmented.[1]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EAL7: Formally Verified Design and Tested</p>
<p>EAL7 is applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in
extremely high risk situations and/or where the high value of the assets
justifies the higher costs.</p>
<p>Practical application of EAL7 is currently limited to TOEs with tightly focused
security functionality that is amenable to extensive formal analysis. The Tenix
Interactive Link Data Diode Device and the Fox-IT Fox Data Diode (one-way data
communications device) claimed to have been evaluated at EAL7 augmented
(EAL7+).[13]</p>
