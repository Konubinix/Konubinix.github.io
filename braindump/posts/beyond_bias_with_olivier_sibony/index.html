<p>Some examples of <a href="/braindump/posts/decision_hygiene/">decisions hygiene</a>:</p>
<h2 id="39c32d10-9079-4524-8f85-a48ceabcf270">don&rsquo;t use scales when measuring something</h2>
<p>Every judgement implies a scale. Two people with the same opinion will have
different absolute scales, like one will need perfection to rate with higher
scale while another one would rate with higher scale unless it is a terrible
stuff.</p>
<p>Instead of having 1, 2, 3 etc, <a href="/braindump/posts/ancrage/">anchor</a> them to have relative comparisons, like
Stuff 1, Stuff 2, Stuff 3. Those are called anchor cases<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And them, instead of assigning a number, ask yourself, is the measured stuff
better than Stuff 1, better than Stuff 2 etc.</p>
<p>It looks like it is less subject to <a href="/braindump/posts/cognitive_bias_standard_deviation/">cognitive bias noise</a>.</p>
<p>Putting anchors in relative scales also allow having an <a href="/braindump/posts/domain_driven_design/">ubiquitous
language</a>. What we choose as reference points will tell a lot about ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="8dced7f7-5403-49b7-9c95-23a00aa35a09"><a href="/braindump/posts/mediating_assessments_protocol/">mediating assessment protocol</a></h2>
<p>Write down the dimensions that are useful to you and consider the ideas on
each of them<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="/braindump/posts/ancrage/">anchoring</a> to be in the appropriate state of mind when taking the decision.</p>
<p>First of all, specify what makes sense, what is important (it may be 1, 2, 7
or 20 dimensions) and assess your choices on each dimension separately (this
is the hard part).</p>
<p>Unless dimensions are highly correlated, assessing dimensions together makes
harder decision taking as the information is diluted. For instance, if people
are to assess a method without separating how they liked it and what they
learned, the result will have a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Then, take a holistic judgement based on seeing all those dimensions
(<a href="/braindump/posts/pareto_efficiency/#id-fc872462-247a-48ae-95aa-85328ce05a53-pareto-front">pareto front</a>).</p>
<p>It is hard, but not that hard after all.</p>
<p>It helps mitigate the <a href="/braindump/posts/binary_thinking/">binary thinking</a>. Also, it helps you make clearer what
actually matters to you and incentivizes being <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectually honest</a>. For
instance, a company that does not take into account the employee comfort in a
decision taking tells a lot about the culture of the company.</p>
<p>This takes into account the fact that <a href="/braindump/posts/ce_qu_on_voit_et_rien_d_autre/">wysiati</a>. You tend to provide an
intuitive judgment based on what you previously had in mind (<a href="/braindump/posts/ancrage/">anchoring</a>). This
protocol tries to ensure what is in your mind before you make your assessment
is as nuanced and holistic as possible. Like <a href="/braindump/posts/nudge/">nudge</a>s, instead of fighting
against your <a href="/braindump/posts/biais_cognitif/">cognitive bias</a>, it empowers them to allow reach a greater
goal. This is similar to the idea that <a href="/braindump/posts/gtd_is_about_regularly_refreshing_your_mind_about_the_tasks_that_matter/">gtd is about regularly refreshing your
mind about the tasks that matter</a>. (<a href="/braindump/posts/don_t_fight_the_way_your_brain_works_work_with_it/">don&rsquo;t fight the way your brain works, work
with it</a>)</p>
<p>Therefore, its important not to discuss the final assessment before you have
discussed each dimension separately, to avoid possible biases that would come
with it.</p>
<p>People, inspired by several decision making processes, want to add weights to
the dimensions so that after assessing on each dimension, a single formula
will tell what it the winner. This approach is iterative and depending on what
the winner is, you adjust the weights. Here, <a href="/braindump/posts/olivier_sibony/">Olivier Sibony</a> claims that people
tend not to trust such system and unconsciously bias it towards the decision
they like. This has the counter productive effect of incentivizing them to
think about the final decision they want beforehand, which is exactly what
this protocol wants to avoid.</p>
<p>Plus, even thought there are several decisions for which formulas tend to work
better than intuitive judgements (because of their determinism and their
tendency to be bias proof) here, it is not the case. We don&rsquo;t know yet how to
reduce a <a href="/braindump/posts/multi_criteria_decision_making/">multi criteria decision making</a> process to a formula. Plus, having a
formula incentivizes the <a href="/braindump/posts/precision_bias/">precision fallacy</a></p>
<p>Therefore, this is more about putting the best conditions for a fruitful
discussion and a <a href="/braindump/posts/machine_associative/">gut feeling</a> decision than an automatic process to provide an
answer. It provides a framework to structure the conversation and keep a
holistic view of what is wanted. Having the dimensions on a MAP really helps
the discussion. People can say that some solution <a href="/braindump/posts/black_or_white_fallacy/">might be good</a> but after
seeing the dimensions it <a href="/braindump/posts/nuance_thinking/">might not be that good after all</a>. You don&rsquo;t do things
like a mean of the assessments. You actually need people to believe in the
solution (otherwise they will retro engineer the protocol to make it provide
their <a href="/braindump/posts/biais_de_confirmation/">prior opinion</a>), hence it must comes from their <a href="/braindump/posts/machine_associative/">guts</a>.</p>
<p>This protocol will show you how well your decision fits with your objectives
and incentivizes <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectual honesty</a>. There will be cases when a last minute
you will realize some dimension is actually important to you. This will be
captured in the system easily. Unlike the <a href="/braindump/posts/pros_and_cons_fallacy/">pros and cons fallacy</a> where people
tend to write + and - and finally ignore the system to provide some <a href="/braindump/posts/machine_associative/">gut
feeling</a> decision<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>To me, this might mitigate but not necessarily remove the <a href="/braindump/posts/avoir_l_intuition_de_faire_les_choses_bien_vs_etre_convaincu_de_faire_les_choses_bien/">biais de bonne
conscience</a>. People might well end taking a decision that theoretically works
but that they know (or should know, if they were <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectually honest</a>) did
not work in the past and then will likely fail again (<a href="/braindump/posts/logic/#983876fe-23bb-4434-9605-38ca4b45059b">induction</a>).</p>
<h2 id="471b2914-f499-466d-8b0f-6b49c2c04bca">use <a href="/braindump/posts/eat_model/">EAT</a> in the <a href="#8dced7f7-5403-49b7-9c95-23a00aa35a09">mediating assessment protocol</a></h2>
<p>I suggest that people use at least the <a href="/braindump/posts/eat_model/">EAT</a> dimensions in their
assessment. Decisions that are small on those scales might well be
theoretically sexy, they are likely to remain on paper only.</p>
<h3 id="cd9a1dc2-82ef-4f02-8c57-ea12de41dc3e">people tend to expect behavior science to provide answers that will prevent the discussion, when it actually only provides appropriate fundation to help people have a <a href="/braindump/posts/fruitful_discussion/">fruitful discussion</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>see,
<ul>
<li><a href="/braindump/posts/overview_of_gtd/#0d5606a4-c231-411c-a520-9b83ffec2c57">gtd won&rsquo;t solve the problem for you. It simply provides a framework so that you can solve your problem</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/braindump/posts/gtd_and_scrum_don_t_fix_your_problem_but_give_you_a_framework_to_see_your_problem_so_that_it_is_easier_for_you_to_fix_it/">gtd and scrum don&rsquo;t fix your problem, but give you a framework to see your problem so that it is easier for you to fix it</a>,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What matters the most is the discussion and reaching a consensus together
that is as <a href="/braindump/posts/biais_cognitif/">biased</a>/<a href="/braindump/posts/cognitive_bias_standard_deviation/">noise</a> proof as possible.</p>
<p>Like in the <a href="/braindump/posts/tragedy_of_bdd_10_years_of_doing_behaviour_driven_development_all_wrong/">tragedy of bdd: 10 years of Doing Behaviour-Driven Development
All Wrong</a> where once the implementation of <a href="/braindump/posts/behavior_driven_development/">BDD</a> was done, people stopped
discussing with each other, doing the exact opposite of what the method was
about.</p>
<h2 id="afd8a819-9caa-4f27-99ed-bd62e008976d">use the mean of several independent assessments</h2>
<ul>
<li>see,
<ul>
<li><a href="/braindump/posts/intelligence_des_foules/">intelligence des foules</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/braindump/posts/nous_sommes_de_mauvais_estimateurs_tous_seuls_mais_de_bon_estimateurs_en_groupe/">nous sommes de mauvais estimateurs tous seuls, mais de bon estimateurs en groupe</a>,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even a person can provide several assessments if a long running project (one
assessment every 3 months for example).</p>
<h2 id="d89b47c9-24ce-40d0-8e74-f2c9f1fd4aca">make people write down their assessment before knowing the one of their colleagues</h2>
<p>Knowing the assessments of others tends to allow <a href="/braindump/posts/groupthink/">groupthink</a>.</p>
<p>Writing it down before hearing about the assessment of other people and reading
it before telling yours makes it more difficult to have <a href="/braindump/posts/groupthink/">groupthink</a>. You will
experience <a href="/braindump/posts/dissonance_cognitive/">cognitive dissonance</a> if you tell something different than what is different from what is written down.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact no one know what you wrote makes it possible and easy to genuinely
change your opinion hearing the arguments of others.</p>
