</ul>
<p>I believe that making a choice is generally considered quite easy and often
tackled with complacency. I think this subject needs more attention.</p>
<p><a href="/braindump/posts/multi_criteria_decision_making/">multi criteria decision making</a> is not a mathematical topic. Its result
heavily depends on the preferences of the person making the choice. The slight
mathematical background only gives a framework to support this decision making.</p>
<p>Do pros and cons, but don&rsquo;t consider they are the objective of the method. They
only serve as note taking to help applying a decision method afterwards (<a href="/braindump/posts/pros_and_cons_fallacy/">pros
and cons fallacy</a>).</p>
<p>Use <a href="/braindump/posts/pareto_efficiency/">pareto efficiency</a>. When there are several criteria, there is no objectively
unique solution. You have to use a tool that won&rsquo;t give you the answer, but that
will provide a mean for you to clearly see your preferences<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, be <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectually honest</a>. If you have a solution that you want to adopt
and you want the method to help you prove it to others, acknowledge this instead
of fouling you in believing you make an objective choice. To me, it is ok to
make the tool show your preferred answer, as long as you are aware of this and
that you trust the tool for setting up limits that will prevent you from lying
to yourself. In other terms, you don&rsquo;t need a tool to spot the correct solution,
you rather need a tool to eliminate the choices that you would intuitively make
but that don&rsquo;t align with your objectives. This is why pros and cons may not be
the only method as people generally need to discuss and chose a solution that
pros and cons initially discouraged.</p>
<p>I believe that using the following method won&rsquo;t allow you at the same time write
objectives you believe in and make a choice that you don&rsquo;t believe is compatible
with them.</p>
<p>The method of making a choice is (to me) iterative, this is not a sequence of
action but stuff that you need to iterate on until they all are satisfying to
you.</p>
<ol>
<li>find the objectives that you want to achieve. Those are the axis of the space
of your choice, (see <a href="/braindump/posts/beyond_bias_with_olivier_sibony/#8dced7f7-5403-49b7-9c95-23a00aa35a09">consider each dimension separately</a>)</li>
<li>write a pros/cons table for each objective. That helps the following step,</li>
<li>write down the hypothesis/constraints that impact the choice of dimensions</li>
<li>write down the non hypothesis/non constraint that you might consider but
decided they won&rsquo;t impact your decision</li>
<li>draw a line for each objective and put the choices on it, in order and with
distance to show how far stuff are from each other with regards to this
objective.
<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t put an explicit beginning and end of the line, so as not to undergo
<a href="/braindump/posts/ancrage/">anchor</a>ing. Instead, put the borders after putting the choices,</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t use graduations, for the same reason. Instead, use your visual
intuition,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>then, measure the distances and convert them to values, normalized so that the
size between beg and end is 1,</li>
<li>then, use those values to find your <a href="/braindump/posts/pareto_efficiency/#id-fc872462-247a-48ae-95aa-85328ce05a53-pareto-front">pareto front</a>ier, eliminating stuff not in
it,</li>
<li>then, watch the result and how each solution provides a difference set of
compromise,</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, even though I think this is the more sensible way to present the steps
of the method, I firmly believe that you&rsquo;ll actually start by looking at
solutions, then you&rsquo;ll have an idea of your objectives. I believe that the
repetition of watching candidate solution, inferring objectives is very
beneficial.</p>
<p>If after all you don&rsquo;t like the result, feel free to <a href="/braindump/posts/rationalisation/">rationalize</a> and change
variables so that the result suits your intuitive judgment. After all, <a href="/braindump/posts/multi_criteria_decision_making/">multi
criteria decision making</a> is as subjective as the choice of your objectives.</p>
<p>Listen to what the system tells you. If you don&rsquo;t manage to rationalize your
preferred answer using such a method, chances are you have no sensible reason to
prefer it. Either decide to choose your preferred solution anyway, it try to
make this solution fit the objectives and measures. Either way, it helps you
being more <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectually honest</a> and have <a href="/braindump/posts/croire_pour_de_bonnes_raisons/">good reasons to believe</a>.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t fear adding plenty of dimensions, chances are that after all you
will compact them afterwards. To me, it is important that the method <a href="/braindump/posts/fruitful_discussion/">supports
the discussion</a>. Thus if at some point a dimension is split in the conversation,
then it should be split in the tool as well. If it is lumped again later, it
will be lumped in the tool as well.</p>
<p>In the end, the tool becomes an accurate visualization on the state of the
discussion/decision taking process. As so, it should be <a href="/braindump/posts/sofa/#d581d00a-ed26-40aa-aa2b-2637672b1700">easy</a>, <a href="/braindump/posts/sofa/#b1cb2308-b971-4de2-b984-4ec6014a7df9">attractive</a> and
<a href="/braindump/posts/sofa/#6d1cfd93-6a91-4f67-9f4b-f62cd9285b9f">timely</a>. If you feel some <a href="/braindump/posts/cognitive_resistance/">cognitive resistance</a> feeding it, it has lost its
purpose.</p>
<h2 id="908fe5bf-afb5-4710-b23e-616f97e931a9">using this method in a team</h2>
<p>For having tried the method a few times with colleagues, I realised that
thinking in term of objectives is not natural at all and that people tend to
focus on solutions and provide reasons that implicitly contain their objectives
but that they don&rsquo;t manage to make them explicit. In that case, I recommend that
you elect an objective keeper whose role is to dig out and make explicit
everything that looks like an objective.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve realised that at first, there are so many arguments that there are
numerous objectives. They tend to naturally diminish when you finally take the
time to consider them.</p>
<p>Therefore, this method also has the advantage of focusing the debate around
whatever consensual objective gets out of the conversation.</p>
<p>Yet, people tend to have very long oral discussion and forget to capture
them. It seems important to continuously remind them that what is told is
forgotten, but what is captured will be persisted and is more likely to have a
positive impact on our decision.</p>
<p>In the end, it is felt as <a href="/braindump/posts/sofa/#b1cb2308-b971-4de2-b984-4ec6014a7df9">unattractive</a> and people tended to let it go.</p>
<h2 id="110f932c-afd9-4130-9f4a-e63472c4165e">what does it look like</h2>
<figure><img src="https://konubinix.eu/ipfs/bafkreiez3psjdysi2tbfy7kxtv4yyebq6eqq44yo6mng5x7zdycogirpbe?filename=a.png">

<p>From the left to the right:</p>
<dl>
<dt>non hypotheses</dt>
<dd>the stuff that won&rsquo;t impact your decisions</dd>
<dt>hypothesis</dt>
<dd>stuff that you consider true that impact your decisions</dd>
<dt>dimensions</dt>
<dd>each line contains a dimension and solutions are evaluated from the left (best) to the right (worst)</dd>
<dt>solutions</dt>
<dd>associated with colored papers to easily place them in the dimensions frame</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this example, the decision taking process was at its beginning, people
added many hypothesis and dimensions, but in the end it will most likely
compact again (<a href="/braindump/posts/expand_and_compress/">breathing model</a>).</p>
<h2 id="a211ad24-afeb-41bd-b99c-27e2dcccf5e7">how to evaluate them?</h2>
<p>Oftentime, you won&rsquo;t know exactly how to put the solutions in the
dimensions. To me, this is normal. I think we always take decisions based on
incomplete knowledge (<a href="/braindump/posts/bayesian_thinking/">bayesian thinking</a>), that does not mean we don&rsquo;t have to
make decisions (<a href="/braindump/posts/analysis_paralysis/">analysis paralysis</a>).</p>
<p>If it is too difficult to evaluate them, you can consider</p>
<ol>
<li>thought experiments,</li>
<li>role games,</li>
<li>POCs,</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, if you cannot evaluate, just remember to <a href="/braindump/posts/four_agreements/#always-id-fd33b753-9b06-4eaa-b275-2bbe9464577f-do-your-best">always do your best</a>. This
method, to me, help you make the best decision you can with the knowledge you
have.</p>
<p><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-11-16 Wed] </span></span> I&rsquo;m actually starting to realize that those role games are
crucial and should be put forward at the beginning of the method. People need
to focus on examples rather that general rules when making decisions.</p>
