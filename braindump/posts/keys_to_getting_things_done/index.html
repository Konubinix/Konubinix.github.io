<blockquote>
<p>[13.00s -&gt; 29.00s]  One of the things that you said at the very beginning of the article that that being productive is all about getting control and that in the first fundamental step is capture it do you find that as people go on that there&rsquo;s still that need to do those on
[29.00s -&gt; 33.00s]  ongoing ongoing capturing sessions.
[33.00s -&gt; 41.00s]  For sure. And what should you be thinking about anything that&rsquo;s got your attention that still.
[41.00s -&gt; 45.00s]  You&rsquo;re not yet appropriately engaged with.
[&hellip;]
[70.00s -&gt; 79.00s]  And those are the things that people are trying to manage in their office, ie, their head, which, as you know by now is a <a href="#2691f0d2-03e0-4380-b0c1-a30baa1bfa50">crappy office</a>.
[79.00s -&gt; 91.00s]  And so, what happens is you lose control by putting stuff in there because that place is out of control relative to remembering reminding and managing the relationships between the commitments you have.
[91.00s -&gt; 104.00s]  It&rsquo;s not, it did not evolve to do that. Your brain did not evolve to do that so that&rsquo;s what you, that&rsquo;s why people feel out of control, simply because they&rsquo;ve got so much stuff that they have not externalized to take a look at more consciously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[607.00s -&gt; 618.00s]  See it and you know that that&rsquo;s a little bit surprising for those of us who have followed you for over the years because it always sounded to me like you were just the supreme list maker.
[618.00s -&gt; 621.00s]  Well, supreme list maker me.
[621.00s -&gt; 622.00s]  I don&rsquo;t know.
[622.00s -&gt; 630.00s]  I got. I got a bunch of lists. So what people have grocery list people have a calendar those are all lists.
[630.00s -&gt; 641.00s]  And the fact that you think I&rsquo;m a supreme list maker just like, well, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re still trying to keep a bunch of lists in your head. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="a6a4ae48-d3ce-4e0f-b9af-bfce1fbc5b8a">there is no rigid gtd way of doing, there are only principles to fulfil to <a href="/braindump/posts/feel_confident_not_doing_what_you_are_not_doing/">feel confident not doing what you are not doing</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[1070.00s -&gt; 1087.00s]  I see people who are trying to follow GTD, you know, very methodically, and very rigidly. And what I&rsquo;ve learned and talking to you is that you know you as the creator of GTD are still willing to kind of like you know, well I do it this way or, well I
[1087.00s -&gt; 1097.00s]  do it this way I mean to kind of modify it, still keeping true to the steps, but also modifying your approach or saying I&rsquo;ll do this now I won&rsquo;t do this now.
[1098.00s -&gt; 1102.00s]  That makes us feel good that you do that.
[1102.00s -&gt; 1108.00s]  I didn&rsquo;t do it, but people create their own canonical view of GTD.
[1108.00s -&gt; 1110.00s]  Yeah, I mean I&rsquo;ve got my own.
[1110.00s -&gt; 1121.00s]  But it includes it has from the beginning, all of this flexibility because it&rsquo;s not about how you know where and how much you capture it&rsquo;s about that that the principle is in your head it&rsquo;s in the wrong place.
[1121.00s -&gt; 1125.00s]  So that&rsquo;s kind of that&rsquo;s canonical GTD.
[1125.00s -&gt; 1132.00s]  But anything in how you do it where you do it and how often you look at it, what to do with that, how, you know,
[1132.00s -&gt; 1139.00s]  you know, as long as you&rsquo;re as long as you&rsquo;re comfortable and feeling confident about what you&rsquo;re doing. You know, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no.
[1139.00s -&gt; 1147.00s]  That is then you&rsquo;re doing as much GTD as you need to do. Yeah.</p>

<p>[1206.00s -&gt; 1215.00s]  when I just have some time I just say okay let&rsquo;s sit down with that blank pad and try to clear our brain and write all it down.
[1215.00s -&gt; 1218.00s]  Sometimes I still feel overwhelmed.
[1218.00s -&gt; 1222.00s]  How do I can I prevent that.
[1222.00s -&gt; 1224.00s]  I don&rsquo;t know.
[1224.00s -&gt; 1229.00s]  You&rsquo;ve surfaced so many new ideas.
[1229.00s -&gt; 1233.00s]  Well, I think if you.
[1233.00s -&gt; 1237.00s]  Why would you feel overwhelmed instead of excited.
[1237.00s -&gt; 1252.00s]  Because I look at the long list and I go I&rsquo;ve only got, you know, seven days a week and I want to play it I want to do all sorts of other things.
[1252.00s -&gt; 1253.00s]  Oh, you&rsquo;re just spoiled.</p>
