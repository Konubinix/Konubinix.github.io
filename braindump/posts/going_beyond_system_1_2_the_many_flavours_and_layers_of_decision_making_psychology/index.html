<p>Going beyond <a href="/braindump/posts/thinking_fast_and_slow/">System 1/2</a> - the many flavours and layers of <a href="/braindump/posts/decision_making_psychology/">decision-making psychology</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1/2 theory is not the only perspective on decision making - there are several differing views in the behavioural science community, each with slightly different assumptions about human nature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basic premise of the influential nudge approach is the concept of bounded rationality - that human beings are fallible, poorly informed as well as suffering from myopia, inertia and self-control issues</p>

<blockquote>
<p>heuristics and biases program (H&amp;B) has uncovered a lot of systematic violations of reasoning and decision making which have led to a loose consensus that humans have innate cognitive limitations which lead us to instinctively rely on heuristics - and occasionally bias us to make predictable error, at least compared to the rational homo economicus benchmark.</p>

<p>core idea of nudging: that the policy makers could leverage people&rsquo;s cognitive and motivational inadequacies as a way to steering them to better decisions for their own long-term welfare - ones that are aligned with their ultimate goals</p>

<blockquote>
<p>heuristics and biases was criticized early on in the 80s as the &ldquo;psychology of first impressions&rdquo;  and that there is more to human decision making and problem solving than their first response in a given situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>early persuasion models: the heuristic-systematic model and the elaboration-likelihood model (ELM), both of which broadly propose that information is processed more systematically only if it is highly relevant or the listener is highly motivated.</p>

<p>Contrary to what many people think, Kahneman did not come up with System 1/2 and in Thinking Fast &amp; Slow he credits it to Stanovich and West</p>

<blockquote>
<p>whenever you see people attributing S1/2 to Kahneman, you should be skeptical of their depth of knowledge (although it would be accurate to say he popularised the terms).</p>
