<p>I can&rsquo;t count how many people claimed to me they &ldquo;knew <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a>&rdquo; and applied it in
their teams. When confronted with their way of working, I could indeed find some
similarities, but above all several anti scrum practices.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say their work habits were bad or unsuited to their context, but I feel
quite a <a href="/braindump/posts/dissonance_cognitive/">cognitive dissonance</a> when I realize that</p>
<ol>
<li>one says they practice scrum</li>
<li>some practice of one is anti scrum</li>
</ol>
<p>see <a href="/braindump/posts/is_not_doing_vs_not_having_to_do/">&ldquo;is not doing&rdquo; vs &ldquo;not having to do&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Some of those issues might be due to the fact that scrum is constantly evolving
and people don&rsquo;t follow the same version of scrum. For instance, scrum has
become <a href="/braindump/posts/noestimate/">#NoEstimate</a> in <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_guide_2020_noestimate/">2020</a>. It becomes another <a href="/braindump/posts/debat_semantique/">semantic debate</a> around what is
scrum, is scrum the last version of another one? Actually, my opinion is that
scrum is the latest definition (<a href="/braindump/posts/static_systems_cognitive_bias/">static systems cognitive bias</a>).</p>
<p>I strongly advise people to be <a href="/braindump/posts/dissonance_cognitive/">coherent</a>, and, still admitting that they are very
efficient, clever etc, they should realize they are not practicing scrum.</p>
<p>I think that <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a> suffers from having a great popularity, such that people
want their ideas to be associated with this word, whatever the meaning of the
method. I think this in unconscious, and that people really think they practice
scrum.</p>

<p>remember that <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">Scrum</a> is a means to an end and not the end itself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Also, remember the <a href="/braindump/posts/loi_de_hume/">is/ought_problem</a>. The discussion whether or not you are
doing scrum are separate from the discussion whether or not scrum is appropriate
for you.</p>
<p>All the <a href="/braindump/posts/velocity/">velocity</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/user_story/">user story</a> stuffs are great, but they are not part of
scrum, so using a tool that enforces them is totally ok.  As long as it does not
contradict scrum, this method can still be called scrum. But if at some point
they contradict the scrum method, either one should consider <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#adaptation">adapting</a> them, or
realize they don&rsquo;t do scrum anymore.</p>

<h2 id="d0a519a7-6d7c-4e25-9232-83b0c79db005">about the <a href="/braindump/posts/daily_meeting/">daily meeting</a></h2>
<h3 id="6df645eb-37ec-4a3a-9bff-1faae134cf3d">dailies are not about telling our live</h3>
<p>In <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily meeting</a>s, I often hear something like</p>
<ol>
<li>yesterday, I did some administrative stuff</li>
<li>today, I have a lot of meetings</li>
</ol>
<p>As stressed out in the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum guide</a>, the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily meeting</a> is a mean to focus on
progress toward the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">spring goal</a>. The scrum method is centered around the common
goal of the team.</p>
<p>Often, a suggested way to conduct the meeting is by asking the three questions :</p>
<ol>
<li>what did I do yesterday to progress toward the goal</li>
<li>what impediment happened that prevented my progress toward the goal</li>
<li>what will I do today to progress toward the goal</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, those questions too often become</p>
<ol>
<li>what did I do yesterday</li>
<li>what impediment happened</li>
<li>what will I do today</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this might due to the fact that we think we have to say something to
appear productive. Someone saying &ldquo;I pass&rdquo; might be seen as a lazy person.</p>

<h3 id="6dd37d3b-b803-42d3-bbd4-96bc6d0cad48">the three questions fallacy</h3>
<p>The daily scrum is not a social daily. The purpose is not to talk about our
day, but to focus on the common goal, committed towards the product owner.</p>
<p>We often see the following 3 questions asked during the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily meeting</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
<li>What will you do today?</li>
<li>Are there any impediments in your way?</li>
</ol>

<p>But in general, I realize that people follow this rule by the book and really
talk about everything they did the day before.</p>

<p>Actually, the 3 questions are not part of the scrum guides. What it says is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/#developers">Developers</a> can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long
as their <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">Daily Scrum</a> focuses on progress toward the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">Sprint Goal</a> and produces an

<p>But if they were, they would be more like:</p>
<ol>
<li>what did I do yesterday <strong>related</strong> to our <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">shared goal</a> committed to our <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/#only-one-product-owner">product owner</a></li>

<p>Initially, these three Daily Scrum questions were added to the Scrum Guide 2017
as an example of how the Scrum team members may inspect the progress toward the
Sprint Goal. However, these three questions quickly became synonymous with the
Daily Scrum. So now, it was all about answering these three questions, turning
the Daily Scrum into a sort of status report meeting, with Developers waiting in
line to “answer these three questions” to the Scrum Master, the Product Owner,
or maybe even a stakeholder.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Instead, we want to understand whether we will meet the Sprint Goal. If the
Scrum team’s progress is doubtful, given recent developments and learning, we
want to take action to get back on track. Any form of a status report is a
mere distraction and wasteful in that respect.</p>

<h2 id="73d9270a-1a99-4dc8-af8a-38f6457d83ed">dailies and team size</h2>
<p>Surfing on the wave of agile methods, and particularly <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a>, we tend to
borrow some useful practices, like the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily meeting</a> It is considered that
time boxing the meeting to 15 minutes is a good idea.</p>
<p>Yet, another aspect of the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a> method is that the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">team shall be quite
small</a> (10 or fewer). The value of 15 minutes is most likely calibrated on this
number.</p>
<p>I can see <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily meetings</a> still restricted to 15 minutes for teams that grow
above 15, giving less than a minute per person. I think this is
counter-productive, as it gives people too few time to express themselves.</p>
