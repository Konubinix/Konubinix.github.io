<p>Use a <a href="/braindump/posts/git/">git</a> repository and only this repository to store the state of the
infrastructure<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Very close to <a href="/braindump/posts/infrastructure_as_code/">IaC</a>, but not necessarily used together. Because
you already know git, you don&rsquo;t need another tool to:</p>
<ul>
<li>view diffs and logs on the state of the infrastructure,</li>
<li>create workflow, like pull request to ensure proper validation before getting
into production,</li>
</ul>
<p>gitops tools check the diff between the git state and the live state at regular
interval, making sure to solve the &ldquo;<a href="#1bd07e71-6cb7-4c62-a83f-353c00170589">configuration drifts</a>&rdquo; and adjusting the live
state to make it reflect the git state.</p>
<p>You have a code repository within which the dev can do whatever they want. Then,
you have the infrastructure repository with much more control. There can be
automated PR<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> from the CI of the dev repository to the ops repository, but manual
control is often preferred.</p>
<p>It is one implementation of <a href="/braindump/posts/devops/">devops</a>, where a <a href="/braindump/posts/source_code_manager/">SCM</a> is the sole interface between
dev and ops<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> (see the misconception of <a href="/braindump/posts/misconceptions_about_devops/#af664b6c-c383-459e-aa54-f7f3fde1f248">making the dev and ops know all the things of DEV + OPS</a>). The ops setup the gitops tooling and the infra repository and the
dev commit stuff in it.</p>
<p>It is more a way of thinking rather than a product or a tool<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Chances are
you will have to create your own worflow depending on what your needs are.</p>
<p>Using a single repository to store the code and the infrastructure state, as it
is often suggested in the 101<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> is to me a bad idea. With infrastructure
state commits, the git history will quickly become messy. Also, both the code
and the infrastructure have very different responsibilities and it seems counter
intuitive to think of mixing them. In my mind, gitops started to make sense only
when I discovered that it was about having (at least) two separate git
repository: one for the code, the other for storing the state. This revelation
happened quite late.</p>
<p>I really got interested in gitops when my company started investigating
<a href="/braindump/posts/discovering_deployment_strategies/">deployment strategies</a>, we quickly realized that we would need much more control
and auditing than simply running <code>helm upgrade</code> in the continuous automation. In
particular, blue/green and canary need a clear understanding of what was/is and
will be put in the clusters. Rollback will be easier as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, in testing, <code>helm upgrade</code> becomes <code>git clone ; copy ; git commit ; git push</code> and putting in production basically is the same thing.</p>
<p>There are several tools implementing gitops. I was led to focus on spinnaker,
argocd and flux. spinnaker is likely to be useful for very big industrial
projects, but several hints nudged me to avoid it.</p>
<p>I first tried flux, that was a very good way to be introduced to gitops. I less
than 5 minutes, I could have a working setup. It also by default suggests to use
flux to manage flux. This is a <a href="/braindump/posts/eating_your_own_dog_food/">dogfooding</a> quality I appreciate.I played a lot
with it and eventually dropped it for two reasons (written on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-05-16 Fri]</span></span>):</p>
<p>The first is the lack of interface to easily understand what is happening.  The
power of gitops lies into its controller doing the job well, and your resources
being appropriate. A lot can go wrong in between the git push and the change
taking place. I could quite easily make flux hang for seemingly no reasons, and
I had to spend more time than I expected debugging flux itself. I tried
capacitor, but it was not much more than an web view of stuff I could already
comfortably consult with the flux cli.</p>
<p>The second and the real no-go is the lack of orphan detection. I was very
disappointed to find out that I could add pods in the namespace of my
application without flux noticing. There are a few discussions on the
matter<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, but that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Trying things with &ldquo;flux create&rdquo; before committing is a good thing (in my mind),
for it provides a small feedback loop and avoids polluting the git history with
&ldquo;wip: trying this&rdquo;, &ldquo;oups, forgot that&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Because of the lack of orphan
detection, it is more than easy to forget about a &ldquo;flux create&rdquo; and having a
testing cluster that works great for bad reasons.</p>
<p>Then, I tried argocd. It comes with too much bells and whistles to my taste, but
at least it provided something to deal with both points. Its interface is very
good.  I often could see at a glance what went wrong thanks to it. On the other
hand, its documentation focuses a lot on the interface. I definitely prefer the
documentation of flux that helps better understanding gitops (to my mind).</p>
<p>Its support for orphaned detection is not ideal<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, bit at least there is
something that I can work with.</p>
<p>Like flux, it eases creating argo resources (with the UI), even though the
<a href="/braindump/posts/custom_resource/">custom resource</a>s themselves are easy to work with anyway.</p>
<p>Both flux and argocd come with side projects (respectively flagger and argo
rollout) to deal with dynamic deployments, like canary. I did not test them yet.</p>
<p>Retrospectively, I would advice to follow the same path I took: Start with flux,
with a very nice and simple documentation, so that you can better understand the
feeling of gitops. Even struggle a bit, trying to install broken helm
charts. And when things get more serious, move to argocd, to get orphaned
resources detection and the nice UI, despite the denser and a bit less intuitive
documentation. If I was more fluent in gitops, I would have rather contributed
to flux than look for an alternative.</p>
<h2 id="1bd07e71-6cb7-4c62-a83f-353c00170589">configuration drifts</h2>
<h2 id="1791e496-cd1b-4835-8cd2-8222c0311bf6">remove the configuration drift</h2>
<h2 id="250a55e2-93b2-4b89-a94a-f615e0e411c6">push based or pull based?</h2>
<p>In ALL the videos I have watched about gitops, they indicated that the main
source of <a href="#1791e496-cd1b-4835-8cd2-8222c0311bf6">configuration drift</a> is when someone gets into the system and makes
some changes manually.</p>
<p>They indicate that this explains the need to have a pull based model, that
will restore the system automatically without waiting for the next CI trigger
to run.</p>
<p>Yet, I think that if the ops can easily reproducibly run the push based
command, they would be <a href="/braindump/posts/nudge/">nudge</a>d into using it rather than going and fixing stuff
live.</p>
<p>To me, the incentive to modify the env in live is a symptom of the <a href="/braindump/posts/ci_automation_drift/">ci
automation drift</a> and should be addressed instead of adding a tool to hide
it.</p>
<p>Doing so, the person running the command should still think about pushing
per change. Right? So that makes the pull model more secure?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. If someone went to the prod to fix something manually, I
think that this person would not accept that the fix would be reverted
automatically after 3 minutes and therefore the fix reverted as well. In that
case, it seems sensible to bet that this person will also disable the pull
based automation. Thus, <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">to be honest</a> we should consider that this person has
the same probabilities of forgetting to enable the pull based flow that the
one that forgot to push per changes in the previous example.</p>
<p>In that case, forgetting to push the fix won&rsquo;t disable the automatic flow,
while in the pull based flow, someone would need to explicitly check and
realize that it was disabled.</p>
<p>Also, in the push based flow scenario, the person doing the fix would be more
likely to see the dirty git status and push per change in the future, whereas
in the pull based scenario no trace of this change would remain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think that we tend to overestimate the value in the pull
based model and underestimate the one of the push based one. Both are great
and have great advantages and the awesome aspects of the pull based flow
should not shadow the great aspects of the push based one.</p>
<h2 id="ccd287bd-a162-4a9c-bba9-d25dbbb78ea6">dealing with secrets</h2>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want the secrets to lie around indefinitely in some git history, that
may well get into the wrong hands in some distant future.</p>
<p>I could find a lot of documentation explaining how sealed secrets and sops
work, but very few descriptions of use cases showing how practical it is.</p>
<p>argocd provide a very high level description of some pros and cons of general
methods<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, flux goes a bit more into the details<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>First, I think one might think about what is the source of truth for the
secrets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first assume the it is the git repository.</p>
<p>In that case, some team member puts a secret in the repository, encrypting it
using the public key. Then, only the cluster may be able to get the secret in
plain text. If one team member needs the secret for a side workflow (like
accessing the database), that person should get access to the secret in the
cluster.</p>
<p>Because this is the source of truth, its secrets need some extra care not to
be lost.</p>
<p>In case the cluster needs to be destroyed, one would need to back the
<code>sealed-secret</code> secret up and restore it in the new cluster. As a matter of
fact, all the secret, including the cluster one, would be backed-up if you
already have a backup solution in place, like <a href="/braindump/posts/velero/">velero</a>, so that might not
be that problematic. It asks the question thought, of whether those backup
might be encrypted as well, like using a <a href="/braindump/posts/shamir_s_secret_sharing/">ssss</a> secret share by the team or
something.</p>
<p>Then, when moving from cluster to cluster (like testing, then staging, then
prod), we have to duplicate those, needing several operations, like extracting
the secrets from a cluster to put in the other one. For shared secrets, one
must think of updating them in all the configurations. I don&rsquo;t see any issue
in automating this, but so far, I did not find any tool already available to
do it.</p>
<p>Now, in case one already uses a secret manager, like aws secret manager,
<a href="/braindump/posts/hashicorp_vault/">hashicorp vault</a> or <a href="/braindump/posts/password_manager/#924f0754-7efe-486e-9418-03c06c835c9e">bitwarden</a>, they should be put in the cluster via some automation
mechanism.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets">external secrets operator</a> would be tempting, as one would only need
to configure the secret access. But it feels like a threat to provide access
from an hot system to a secret store. A lot of things could go wrong. One
might prefer that the entity accessing the secret store does it out of the
part dealing with the ingress and possible attacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some automation could setup the sealed secret and
sops. This collides with one hypothesis of cryptography: the generation of an
encrypted data should not be deterministic, to avoid guessing attacks. For
that reason, if the automation simply generates all the encrypted data, then
every time git would show some difference. One might accept having some way to
tell whether a secret has changed or not, ideally using a hmac to avoid the
guessing attacks. There is a <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/issues/376">discussion in sealed-secret</a> about that suggestion
but nothing tangible got out of it. It is unclear to me, though, when this
automation would take place. It&rsquo;s place is obvious in the testing cluster,
because it reflects the state of automatic git commit after the build of the
new images. This automatic git commit can also automatically commit the new
versions of the secrets. For the production cluster though, where a manual
commit is needed to acknowledge the deployment, it might be easy to have a
drift between what is in the secret store and what is in the repository. One
might end up being puzzled to see some behavior in the cluster not coherent
with what one sees in the secret store, forgetting that the source of truth of
the cluster is in fact the repository.</p>
<p>Finally, one might simply want to install the secret automatically, without
using git at all. In that case, we loose a bit of the auditing promise of
gitops, as something might go wrong because of a change of secret that would
not be traced.</p>
<p>In the end, it appears to me that there is definitely no silver bullet.</p>
<p>My personal preference would be to use git as the single source of truth with
some tooling to ease migrating secrets from cluster to cluster.</p>
<p>But, because I currently work in an organisation using a central secret store,
I would go to the solution suggested in the sealed secret discussion, store
them in git automatically, with a way to identify the changes.</p>

<p>By listening to those, I understand that that gitops is about having one git
repository as database for storing the desired state of the ops, because git
has the characteristics that we like : auditability, fine control,
immutability, easy to rollback.</p>
<p>gitops tools are focused on looking at this git repository and applying this
desired state. It is like real time <a href="/braindump/posts/infrastructure_as_code/">infrastructure as code</a>.</p>
<p>To do so, we need a separate deploy repository, because security rules, the
use of the commit history (a lot of automatic commits in the deploy repo) will
not be the same at all.</p>
<p>Using the same repository for both will most likely pollute the dev repository
with a lot of automatic commit and make it barely readable.</p>
