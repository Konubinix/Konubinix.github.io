</ul>
<p>on the <a href="/braindump/posts/human_risk_podcast/">human risk podcast</a>, with <a href="/braindump/posts/olivier_sibony/">Olivier Sibony</a></p>
<p>The question that <a href="/braindump/posts/olivier_sibony/">Olivier Sibony</a> wanted to tackle was: Why do we tend to
make the same mistakes, when it does not follow our incentives and people around
us can tell us it is a mistake?</p>
<p>We tend to explain errors of people making decision with internal
characteristics, like hubris or stupidity (see <a href="/braindump/posts/erreur_fondamentale_d_attribution/">fundamental attribution error</a>). A
more <a href="/braindump/posts/principe_de_parcimonie/">parsimonious hypothesis</a> would be do assume that those people, like you and
me, make systematic mistakes (<a href="/braindump/posts/biais_cognitif/">cognitive bias</a>) and look for answers into our
<a href="/braindump/posts/decision_making_strategies/">decision making strategies</a>. In other terms, in 100 people make similar mistakes,
then it is simpler to assume one cause rather than 100 individual causes.</p>
<p>Concluding that it is the fault of a few bad apples is a <a href="/braindump/posts/red_herring/">red herring</a>,
because it prevents us from improving ourselves. The hard part here is that the
<a href="/braindump/posts/last_thing_the_fish_sees_is_the_water_around_it/">last thing the fish sees is the water around it</a> and we tend to be blind to our
own biases and see only the biases of others.</p>
<p>Actually, this is what the work of <a href="/braindump/posts/olivier_sibony/">Olivier Sibony</a> seems to be about. Making
the decision makers include other people that are more likely to spot their
&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; errors in the decision making process.</p>
<p>In case the <a href="/braindump/posts/avoir_raison_pour_de_mauvaises_raisons/#9c962669-0352-4873-8c92-bc923b88eade">outcome of a decision is bad, people should not put the decision
into question</a>, because they could not have known it (<a href="/braindump/posts/retrospective_bias/">retrospective bias</a>). We
should evaluate the decision and the rewards at the time the decision is made,
not at the time the outcome is known.</p>
<p>The main issue in enterprises is that they delude themselves into believing
every thing is under control (<a href="/braindump/posts/illusion_of_control/">illusion of control</a>). What you want to hear is
&ldquo;everything is under control, there is no risk&rdquo;. When presented with a strategy,
there is generally a page about the known risks and about the mitigation parts,
as if we had shed some light on the unknown. People should rather embrace the
<a href="/braindump/posts/unknown_unknowns/">unknown unknowns</a> and the probability they will happen instead of being blind to
them. Like in finance or in poker playing, you don&rsquo;t know what will happen, but
you can still assess them in the decision taking, instead of believing that
everything will go alright because you have &ldquo;mitigated the risks&rdquo;. instead, most
people act as if risk should be eliminated rather than acknowledged.</p>
