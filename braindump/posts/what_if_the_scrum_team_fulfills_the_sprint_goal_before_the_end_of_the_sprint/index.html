</ul>
<p>Some common <a href="/braindump/posts/misconceptions_about_scrum/">misconceptions about scrum</a>, suggesting that the sprint should
optimize the amount of work instead of reaching the agreed outcome that was
meant to optimize the value.</p>
<p>what if the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/">scrum team</a> fulfills the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">spring goal</a> before the end of the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#99fecbee-b369-4e6d-9292-f9a566a8e028">sprint</a>?</p>
<p>As long as it is the most valuable thing to be done and that the sprint is short
enough, that should be ok<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, shouldn&rsquo;t it? If there is bonus work that can
be achieved during that iteration, that&rsquo;s for the better<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/#developers">developers</a> fulfil the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">sprint goal</a> before the end of the sprint or think
they finally won&rsquo;t be able to make it by the end of the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#99fecbee-b369-4e6d-9292-f9a566a8e028">sprint</a>, they have to
<a href="/braindump/posts/renegotiate_your_engagements/">renegotiate</a> the scope of the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">sprint goal</a> to have one that fits. This means that
most of the first sprints will end with discussions with the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/#only-one-product-owner">product owner</a> to
adjust the scope until the team finds its velocity.</p>
<p>Also, it may be the symptom of the misconception that the <a href="/braindump/posts/misconceptions_about_scrum/#8efaa096-c60c-4289-a485-83037ae5d2c7">sprint goal is about a
bunch of work, not the outcome</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Remember that the goal is a tool to help
people <a href="/braindump/posts/values_of_scrum/#focus--scrum">focus</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> towards a common objective (a.k.a. behave as a <a href="/braindump/posts/committed_entity/#b06f40fa-14b9-4bda-966b-c9596b80a16a">team</a>).</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;goal&rdquo; does not fulfil its purpose, the team should <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#adaptation">adapt</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>External reference: <a href="https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/40788/finding-sprint-goal-diverse-team">https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/40788/finding-sprint-goal-diverse-team</a>
Finding a <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">Sprint Goal</a> to a diverse team</p>
<p>The case that the team works on separate issues on totally different
technologies<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> does not change the fact that they can agree on an outcome that
should be reached by the end of the current sprint<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Whatever is done should make
sure it does not jeopardize that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bce737c3-5efd-43da-bf3f-4b701f9d8e0f">being committed towards the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">sprint goal</a> does not necessarily mean always working towards it</h2>
<p>Also, the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">sprint goal</a> is said to be a <a href="/braindump/posts/engagement/">commitment</a> to be done by the end of the
sprint, but not at all that the sprint goal should be the only thing on what we
work. If the team finishes the goal early, then can work on something else,
provided that it is the <a href="/braindump/posts/next_action/">next action</a> that is the most valuable (the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/#only-one-product-owner">product
owner</a>&rsquo;s role is to help assessing this). The only thing that changes is that
the team is not committed to end this by the end of the sprint.</p>
<p>If that happens to often, the team should <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#inspection">realize this</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#adaptation">adapt</a> by adjusting some parameter,
like the sprint size, the way the goals are defined or estimated, the
<a href="/braindump/posts/definition_of_done/">definition of done</a>,&hellip;.</p>
<p>Also, even if the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team_is_cross_functional/">scrum team is cross-functional</a>, that does not mean that
everyone can work on the sprint goal at any point in time. It makes sense them
to let team members that cannot work towards the sprint goal work on the next
most important things that they can move forward. The only imperative of the
method is to have the whole team committed towards the sprint goal. That means
that in at some point, the developers that could not contribute can contribute,
then they should fill the duty to let their work behind to focus on the sprint
goal. Also, they have the duty to still feel concerned about this goal and react
whenever they realize they have some important information that would help.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="/braindump/posts/jira/">jira</a> help with this, as one can put some tickets into the &ldquo;jira
sprint&rdquo;. As long as the team always focus on the sprint goal, they should be
able to now what tickets are needed to be done by the end of the sprint to
fulfil the goal and what are only meant to still have work to do when one
cannot contribute to the sprint goal. Also, the &ldquo;jira sprint&rdquo; can be adjusted
at will, as long as the team always keep in mind the sprint goal to fulfil. We
could even imagine that all the tickets of the &ldquo;jira sprint&rdquo; could be dropped
and a bunch of new ones are added, as long as the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_team/">scrum team</a> feels confident
that the sprint goal is still to be achieved.</p>

<p>the slack time afforded by a sprint whose goal was completed early is a blessing

refactor or improve the maintainability of your system.</p>
