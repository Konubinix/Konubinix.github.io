<p>Talks about <a href="/braindump/posts/dichotomy_of_control/">dichotomy of control</a>.</p>
<p>If you focus of stuff you don&rsquo;t have control of, you will have unpleasant
emotion that you won&rsquo;t even undertsand where they come from (<a href="/braindump/posts/reticular_activating_system/">reticular system</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/braindump/posts/voluntary_discomfort/">voluntary discomfort</a> is explained by the idea that what is pleasant now often
leads to unpleasant consequences later and what is unpleasant now often leads to
pleasant stuff later. If you have an idea of your ideal self, you can accept
some <a href="/braindump/posts/voluntary_discomfort/">voluntary discomfort</a> now to reach it later. No one generally wants to by
unhealthy, but eating, having parties and not exercising bring immediate
pleasant feeling that leads to this state. By contrast, if you want to be
healthy, the <a href="/braindump/posts/voluntary_discomfort/">voluntary discomfort</a> of exercising helps reaching that goal. Also,
learning stuff is often long and complicated, but it helps reaching a goal of
being educated.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="/braindump/posts/do_what_you_enjoy_doing_while_enjoying_what_you_ought_to_do/">do what you enjoy doing, while enjoying what you ought to do</a>. Being used
to <a href="/braindump/posts/voluntary_discomfort/">voluntary discomfort</a> helps when the discomfort is not voluntary anymore, like
it happens sometimes in life. By getting used to reinforcing your tolerance, you
become a kind of &ldquo;super being&rdquo; that will absorb more easily such things when
they happen. It also help feeling gratitude for the comfort when it gets back.</p>
<p><a href="#people-don-t-listen-with-their-ears-they-listen-with-their-eyes">People don&rsquo;t listen with their ears, they listen with their eyes</a>, if you want to
teach something, you need to show it as an example.</p>
<p>If you ask yourself how to live a good life, your basic needs are already
fulfilled (<a href="/braindump/posts/pyramide_de_maslow/">Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs</a>). It help getting a <a href="/braindump/posts/view_from_above/">view from above</a> and
realize how lucky you already are.</p>
<p>As member of a community, you have to help your siblings grow, but the only
thing you can control is yourself. In the end, some people will never change and
there is nothing you can do about it. So, <a href="/braindump/posts/do_your_best/">do your best</a>, live a good life as
an example, and <a href="/braindump/posts/dichotomy_of_control/">focus on what you can control: yourself</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#best-way-to-teach-is-to-be-an-example">best way to teach is to be an example</a>.</p>
<p>Trying to help people against their will leads to <a href="/braindump/posts/dissonance_cognitive/">cognitive dissonance</a> and a
<a href="/braindump/posts/reactance/">boomerang effect</a>. People need to grow at their own pace and the only think you
can do is provide small occasional <a href="/braindump/posts/dissonance_cognitive/">cognitive dissonances</a> and be an example when
they need one.</p>
<p>Change is not easy, it is a struggle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. When someone gets its <a href="#dissonance-cognitive--dissonance-cognitive-dot-md--happens-when-someone-breaks-my-reality">reality
broken</a>, it takes time to recover. Adding on top of this already weak state only
leads to frustrated people that won&rsquo;t learn anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of continuously trying to make people better, simply show
them the example, by <a href="/braindump/posts/do_your_best/">doing your best</a> and let them learn and change at their own
pace.</p>
<p>Sometimes, self-improvement is the best way to improve the world<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-become-the-person-you-want-to-be--moi-dot-md">how to become the <a href="/braindump/posts/moi/">person you want to be</a></h2>
<p>To become a better version of yourself, you need to visualize it and reverse
engineer what makes it a good person and try to do the same things (<a href="/braindump/posts/ethique_de_la_vertu/">Ã©thique de la vertu</a>).</p>
<p>It sounds like trying the <a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/#52d90af9-086e-4efe-be16-3a8dcf1f96e1">horizons of focus</a> of the person you want to be and use
<a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/">gtd</a> to help find out whether your actions are compatible with it, giving you
hints above how you need to adapt and change your actions.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="/braindump/posts/loi_de_hume/">is/ought_problem</a>, there is not clear path from the ought to the
is. Therefore, you need to actively acknowledge who you are (is), who you want
to be and (ought) and the path to make it happen.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/#05b2c84b-7550-469e-a0d1-f059847593ea">capture</a> what is in your mind to have a clearer view of what you are and
what you want to be<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Visualize what person you want to be. It will put yourself in the state of mind
to reach that vision. Similar idea than <a href="/braindump/posts/definition_of_done/">what done means</a>. You will agree to
<a href="/braindump/posts/voluntary_discomfort/">voluntary discomfort</a> as well here for you understand it will help you
become the person you want to be.</p>
<p>Set up rules with an optimistic state of mind but act with a <a href="/braindump/posts/pessimistic/">pessimistic</a> point
of view in the short vision. When you cross the street, you look left and right
to check for incoming cars. An <a href="/braindump/posts/optimistic/">optimistic</a> point of view would not check. Here, it
is suggested to be <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectually honest</a> and acknowledge the hard facts at
the current time, even though the rules are optimistic.</p>
