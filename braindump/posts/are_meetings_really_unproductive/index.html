        <h1>Are Meetings Really Unproductive?</h1>
		<span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><a href="/braindump/tags/fleeting/">Fleeting</a></span></p>
        <p>It seems like a lot of people say that they where attending meeting and
therefore they were not productive.</p>
<p>Is it because they don&rsquo;t <a href="/braindump/posts/feel_confident_not_doing_what_you_are_not_doing/">feel confident not doing what they are not doing</a>?</p>
<p>What does productive mean anyway?</p>
<p>At first glance, I think that there are two issues here.</p>
<ol>
<li>people attend regular followup meeting and feel forced to justify the time
they spent. This might trigger a kind of <a href="/braindump/posts/syndrome_de_l_imposteur/">impostor syndrom</a> when they just
cannot say &ldquo;I did this and that&rdquo;.</li>
<li>people don&rsquo;t see the link between the meeting goal and their
<a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/#52d90af9-086e-4efe-be16-3a8dcf1f96e1">horizons of commitment</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that 1. is likely to be quite spread, because people tend to forget that
<a href="/braindump/posts/misconceptions_about_scrum/#6df645eb-37ec-4a3a-9bff-1faae134cf3d">dailies are not about telling our live</a>. Also, we tend to focus such meeting on
people, asking each one what they did do, instead of focusing on the goal,
asking what is the plan to make it move forward today.</p>
<h2 id="cd746676-c56c-4bf7-8272-e37d40898732">will imposing a time keeper on meetings help?</h2>
<p>Another complaint that I here often is that meeting are too long. The solution
that people appear to unanimously take is enforce time constraints.</p>
<p>To me, this is another case of the <a href="/braindump/posts/avoir_l_intuition_de_faire_les_choses_bien_vs_etre_convaincu_de_faire_les_choses_bien/">feeling good bias</a>. To me, what happens is:</p>
<ul>
<li>people realize that the meeting wastes a lot of time,</li>
<li>an idea that immediately comes to mind is to force the meeting to take less time,</li>
<li>this idea <a href="/braindump/posts/aisance_cognitive/">comes to mind so easily</a> that the <a href="/braindump/posts/controleur_paresseux/">system 2</a> let it go though,</li>
<li>people share it immediately, leading to <a href="/braindump/posts/groupthink/">groupthink</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, those people did not take the take to try to understand what caused the
meeting to take too much time. They try to mitigate the consequence instead of
the cause. In my experience, it does not help solve anything in the medium and
long run.</p>
<p>Meetings are a part of our collective organisation. If there is something
going wrong with them, it most likely mean that there is something going wrong
with the way we decided to work together.</p>
<p>Something striking then is how much people don&rsquo;t want to apply methods and
therefore how predictable the long meeting effect is. And yet they won&rsquo;t
realize that this is the expected consequence and simply work on the &ldquo;long
meeting&rdquo; effect. see <a href="/braindump/posts/misconceptions_about_scrum/#6dd37d3b-b803-42d3-bbd4-96bc6d0cad48">misconception about the daily meeting</a>.</p>
<p>The daily meeting is well suited to suffer from the &ldquo;long meeting&rdquo; effect,
because people tend to apply the <a href="/braindump/posts/misconceptions_about_scrum/#6dd37d3b-b803-42d3-bbd4-96bc6d0cad48">three questions fallacy</a>, making it very
vague in its objective and therefore very prone to people using it to share
any thought that comes to mind.</p>
<p>I am inclined to judge the decision of adding a time constraint as counter
productive. <a href="/braindump/posts/remove_constraints_don_t_add_some/">remove constraints, don&rsquo;t add some</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, I feel like this fall into the <a href="/braindump/posts/pkms_vs_ckms/#c585c83a-00e5-44fe-93c4-5106c10d0337">CKMS tragedy</a>.</p>
