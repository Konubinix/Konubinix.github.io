        <h1>Horizons of Git Commit</h1>
		<span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><a href="/braindump/tags/fleeting/">Fleeting</a></span></p>
        <p>When writing code, there are several milestones you generally reach.</p>
<p>When teaching git to colleagues, I realized I always told the same story, so I
decided to write it down once and for all.</p>
<p>I hope it gives some general guidelines of what to commit, push and tag and what
to write in the commit messages.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that people that write 100K lines commit with the message &ldquo;fix
test&rdquo; don&rsquo;t have bad intention. Also, I think that this kind of commit is
problematic.</p>
<p>I hope that getting the feeling of how (I think) you should publish your work,
you will eventually have the habit of doing somehow correct (at least for me)
commits.</p>
<h2 id="an-intended-pun">An intended pun</h2>
<p>Naming those &ldquo;horizons of git commit&rdquo; is a pun with the <a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/#52d90af9-086e-4efe-be16-3a8dcf1f96e1">horizons of commitment</a>
from the <a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/">gtd</a>. But after smiling a bit, I realize those are quite related. In
both cases it is a way to describe how you feel with relativity to your work
and it gives guidelines to your future work. Also, even if I describe them in
a bottom up order, sometimes you have to consider them in a top down fashion,
like when the tag is the objective that drives the rest.</p>
<p>Here are the horizons I can think of so far.</p>
<h2 id="horizon-1-ctrl-c-the-word-sentence-commitment">Horizon 1: Ctrl-C: the word/sentence commitment</h2>
<p>You generally don&rsquo;t press CTRL-C at any random time during code writing. You
generally press it after finishing a word, a sentence or a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is your way of saying: &ldquo;I ended something that makes sense. If my program
crashes, I want to go back from here.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="horizon-2-git-commit-the-elementary-intention-commitment">Horizon 2: git commit: the elementary intention commitment</h2>
<p>When you have edited and saved a file, another file and yet another file, you
reach a program state that make sense as a whole. Something that builds, that
you can explain.</p>
<p>In that case, it is time to create a git commit. As a message, you explain what
this group of changes brought to the program. You generally explain the
intention here, like &ldquo;Add the support for feature X&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The intention generally does not reflect exactly what you did to the files, so
please here avoid syntactic description of the message like &ldquo;Added a comment&rdquo;,
&ldquo;removed a line&rdquo;, &ldquo;added a parameter&rdquo; but tell semantically what you wanted to
do, like &ldquo;explained the algorithm&rdquo;, &ldquo;make code clearer by removing unused line&rdquo;
or &ldquo;exposed the feature X&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t be to vague on the intention. Don&rsquo;t write &ldquo;fixed tests&rdquo; but instead
tell why the tests failed in the first place and what you did to fix
them. Again, don&rsquo;t tell syntactically your actions, like &ldquo;added the character
&rsquo;s&rsquo;&rdquo;, but describe it semantically, like &ldquo;make the message coherent&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, if you feel like describing your intention involves the term &ldquo;AND&rdquo;, that
probably means that your commit is no elementary. You definitely want to split
it in two commits.</p>
<p>For instance, &ldquo;Added the function X and used it to implement Y&rdquo; should become
one commit &ldquo;Added function X&rdquo; and another &ldquo;Used function X to implement Y&rdquo;. If
you feel like both are intrinsically connected and should be committed together,
most likely this summary is a detail and you should think about the bigger
picture intention, like &ldquo;Implementing feature Y&rdquo; and then, as message body, you
can tell that this implied &ldquo;Implementing function X&rdquo;. Yet in that particular
generic example, I still believe two commits are better than one commit.</p>
<h2 id="horizon-3-git-push-the-story-commitment">Horizon 3: git push: the story commitment</h2>
<p>At some point in time, you find out that the succession of commits you did made
a coherent whole. For instance, you implemented a feature, tested it and made
use of it in some other part of the program.</p>
<p>At that point, you should have the feeling that someone getting the code in its
current state could play with it without getting the feeling that some work was
in progress.</p>
<p>This is in general the good time to push your work, so that others can pull it
and use it.</p>
<p>You generally want to take a look at the commits to rework them before hand, yet
in collaborative work, <a href="/braindump/posts/git_history_should_tell_a_story_really/">I understand it is not easy</a>.</p>
<p>There are two common behavior I don&rsquo;t encourage:</p>
<ul>
<li>One is to push after each commit (svn style). This makes the remote branch
show your work in progress instead of something publishable;</li>
<li>The other is to never push, because you always feel like you are in work in
progress. I feel like you have to give yourself small iterative objectives and
each push should be the reflect of such step.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="horizon-4-git-tag-the-publishing-commitment">Horizon 4: git tag: the publishing commitment</h2>
<p>At a final point, you realize that you have reached a milestone. The successive
stories you wrote tell a bigger story that you want to tell the world.</p>
<p>Also, you know that in the future, if at some point, you&rsquo;ll want to advice
someone to use your product, you can advice this version.</p>
<p>Also, if at any point in time you need to take a step back because you don&rsquo;t
like your work, you will always able to rely on this version to start again.</p>
<p>In general, this is the good time to create a tag.</p>
