<p>For him, there was no clear difference between when he was considered developer
and when he was considered architect.</p>
<p>For him, it is indeed defined by the <a href="/braindump/posts/important_decisions_as_measured_by_the_cost_of_change/">important decisions, as measured by the
cost of change</a>. But he criticizes this way of putting it because it does not
emphasizes enough the <a href="/braindump/posts/evolutionary_architecture/">evolutionary architecture</a>. It suggest that we knew the
answer before hand, while for him, we learn them along the way. Also, he suggest
that there is no clear threshold between significant and not significant.</p>
<p>He proposes the definition &ldquo;the stuffs that we hoped we knew before the
project&rdquo;. For him, it is a good definition because it (<a href="/braindump/posts/modestie_epistemique/">epistemic modesty</a>) shows
that we don&rsquo;t pretend being right at the beginning and give room to change our
mind when new information comes.</p>
<p>He emphasises the need to have <a href="/braindump/posts/freedom_to_make_mistakes/">freedom to make mistakes</a>, to learn from it and
fix it along the way. (<a href="/braindump/posts/continuous_improvement/">continuous improvement</a>).</p>
<p>It is a tourist map showing what the goal is and how the system is supposed to
reach it. It is a <a href="/braindump/posts/verite/#id-d7681faf-43c8-4561-9fd7-34ccb6492337-vérité-id-35bbe2e8-b519-467b-9a53-d4cd69a0b100-épistémique">vérité épistémique</a> map, that changes along with new experience.</p>
<p>This tourist map sows the outcomes so that we can refer to it to take decision
and make it evolve along the way.</p>
<p><a href="/braindump/posts/when_the_facts_change_i_change_my_mind_what_do_you_do_sir/">when the facts change, I change my mind. what do you do, sir?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a snapshot of the shared understanding of the expert developers</p>
<p>&mdash; <a href="/braindump/posts/dave_farley/">Dave Farley</a>, referring to <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/">software architecture</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should not expect it to change often, but we SHOULD expect it to change.</p>
<p>At first, cannot honestly know what will work, therefore we have to
<a href="/braindump/posts/guestimate/">guestimate</a>. Hence the need to have people that have an very <a href="/braindump/posts/education_du_systeme_1/">educated system 1</a> to
make those. Then, we start building this tourist map. When the experience shows
what works and what does not, we can adjust the tourist map.</p>
<p>The tourist map is mostly useful to be used in discussions about what we want to
do with our product. It helps us explore the expected implications of our
choices.</p>
<p>For him, the <a href="/braindump/posts/software_architecture/">software architecture</a> influences a lot the shape that the system
will have. Therefore in a sense, the shape of the system is a reflect of the
architecture. And then, every system has an architecture, even if emerging from
nowher, and likely a <a href="/braindump/posts/big_ball_of_mud/">big ball of mud</a> if not thought by people with <a href="/braindump/posts/education_du_systeme_1/">educated
system 1</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the upfront design should be just enough, not to big, but not empty either.</p>
<p><a href="/braindump/posts/big_design_up_front_is_dumb_but_doing_no_design_up_front_is_even_dumber/">big design up front is dumb, but doing no design up front is even dumber</a></p>
<p>If we do a good work, we have to realize that the tourist map WONT be up-to-date
and update it. We should not make the assumption that this map is static.</p>
<p>This map is a way to have a better view of the <a href="/braindump/posts/gestalt/">gestalt</a> of the system to help
thinking about important decisions. It shows the current visions, the current
state and evolves when those evolve.</p>
<p>For him, definitions using «<a href="/braindump/posts/cross_functional_requirements/">non functional requirements</a>» don&rsquo;t help, because
they lose the focus on the fact that everything is important, otherwise we would
not think about it. Yet he acknowledge that those are likely the stuff that
other people (marketing etc) will more likely understand and focus on.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="/braindump/posts/cross_functional_requirements/">non functional requirements</a> are, for him, actually <a href="/braindump/posts/cross_functional_requirements/">cross cutting
concerns</a>, and impact the system at several different places. Therefore, they
are indeed very impacting and have a high <a href="/braindump/posts/cost_of_change/">cost of change</a></p>
<p>For him, the decisions of every developer may impact the architecture of the
system. It is a good thing to have <a href="/braindump/posts/master_builder/">master builder</a> that take decisions, but ALL
the developers should be involved to avoid the <a href="/braindump/posts/application_design_and_straw_man_fallacy/">ivory tower effect</a>. Having the
tourist map helps understanding the impacts of the changes, even the small ones
made by the developers.</p>
<p>He says that we should set up measures to test that the hypothesis we made in
the tourist map are true or false. We should setup tests about those.</p>
<p>As soon as someone says I don&rsquo;t know, treat that as a Seam, a separate concern
in the design.</p>
<p>You should not investigate on all the stuff at first, but keep those in mind and
build your system <a href="/braindump/posts/do_your_best/">as best as you can</a> to help you deal with it in the future.</p>
<p>Be intentionaly a bit vague about the details, so that it won&rsquo;t engage you too
much and becomes a burden rather than a design helper.</p>
