<li>eugercek:  21:11:30&gt; Do you guys take notes for blogs?(First timer in here if channel is for development only please let me know!)</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:17:32&gt; What do you mean ?</li>
<li>eugercek:  21:19:51&gt; Do you take notes while reading blog posts?</li>
<li>eugercek:  21:21:01&gt; I&rsquo;m trying to understand how people take notes with org-roam. I tend to give reference for every link I read and I don&rsquo;t know is it good approach?</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:47:51&gt; Ok, I get it. I can share mine. In my android phone, I use hypothesis to take quotes and comments on web sites</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:48:53&gt; And Librera PRO (from fdroid) for pdfs</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:49:40&gt; To the best of my knowledge, Librera is the only FOSS pdf reader on android that provide text selection</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:49:54&gt; Then, from librera, I share to Orgzly</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:51:22&gt; Now, in my PC, my web browser is qutebrowser. It allows to run arbitrary scripts and zathura for pdf thzat also provide a (very basic) way of triggering a script</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:52:29&gt; When reading websites, I can directly call emacsclient with the appropriate selected region and url to create a note</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:53:34&gt; In zathura, when selecting a text, it is automaticzlky put to the clipboard, so the script I configured uses xclip to get it and then call emacsclient as well</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:54:36&gt; Then, to get the notes fro: my phone, I use hypothesis.el to gather my phone note from hypothesis and have a command to put those quotes in appropiate roam nodes</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:55:19&gt; And, using git-annex, I have folders synced with my phone, so that I can retrieve the pdf note from orgzly</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:55:48&gt; I think I told about everything I use :-)</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:56:29&gt; Then, my roam nodes at first are just aggregates of quotes, like this <em>braindump/posts/2b837d86-c5c3-4d51-b03a-134373bc0427</em>?title=theorie_argumentative_du_raisonnement</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:57:37&gt; But when I consolidate them, I had opinions, interpretations and structure, it then looks likesthis <em>blog/posts/ae37b219-5eb7-41d7-9687-5a52fb9821f1</em>?title=what_should_i_put_into_those_scopes_and_access_tokens_claims</li>
<li>konubinix:  21:58:13&gt; I assume that at some point, I will consider the content as ready enough, so that I can tag it evergreen</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:00:46&gt; /blog/9b9dc018-3a12-4fd4-960b-52737ac9f671?title=why%5Fdo%5Fthe%5Fsame%5Fgit%5Fcommits%5Fnot%5Fhave%5Fthe%5Fsame%5Fhash</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:00:51&gt; Does this help ,</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:00:53&gt; ?</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:03:29&gt; Thanky you so much. I&rsquo;m searching programs you mentioned.</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:04:08&gt; Can you find your notes realted to a book x at any point? I afraid of losing the resource I get the ideas.</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:04:26&gt; Also very good setup of yours :D</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:05:23&gt; I&rsquo;ve not read to-be-quoted books since I&rsquo;ve been playing with roam</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:05:55&gt; But I&rsquo;ve tried simply taking photpraphs, with mitigated success</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:07:12&gt; /braindump/8abbd0ea-635e-4d03-8c2d-f6587d544a5b?title=aisance%5Fcognitive</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:07:33&gt; But I don&rsquo;t like this</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:08:48&gt; Hard to search</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:09:19&gt; Btw I&rsquo;m taking notes about your note taking to improve my note taking :D</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:12:25&gt; I probably shouldn&rsquo;t ask this and just read, I&rsquo;ll, How to take smart notes. But I write everything I don&rsquo;t know in books. And I read mostly web dev only I couldn&rsquo;t convince  myself that thse should be notes. Do you have any restriction strategy?</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:35:29&gt; I don&rsquo;t</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:36:44&gt; But that&rsquo;s the beauty of it: you don&rsquo;t know the note will be useful until it suddenly is</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:37:39&gt; And most of the stimuli you are confronted to won&rsquo;t become notes.</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:38:20&gt; I guess ypu have to be in peace with that</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:38:48&gt; Also, I realize I seldom take notes at my first reading</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:39:58&gt; But one day I realize that I have a question, my second brains says it does not know the topic but my biological brain remembers some book/web site/thesis about that stuff</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:40:19&gt; Then, I read it again, at take the notes that answer my question</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:40:46&gt; Recently, I wondered wheter HATEOAS is actually in the initial REST documents</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:40:58&gt; I read the thesis with that in mind</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:41:14&gt; And I&rsquo;m at the state of bag of quotes -&gt; <em>braindump/posts/9c105b00-c13b-43f3-96e3-f74fd65b6935</em>?title=representational_state_transfer</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:42:25&gt; IIUC, the idea is that with time, my second brain becomes a conversation partner that tells me ancient stuff I believed and forgot</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:42:40&gt; hence I try to make the habit of nicely asking it</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:43:46&gt; Fun story, last month, I told my opinion about organizing git repos with colleagues</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:44:21&gt; I then suggested they read my written opinion <em>braindump/posts/4e310528-a716-4639-96ad-0cc5dcb2854d</em>?title=pragmatic_git_workflow</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:44:45&gt; They read it and then told me it did not say the same as I just told them</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:44:56&gt; :D</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:45:10&gt; I read the note and realized my past self was much more inspired than I was</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:45:45&gt; My conversation partner convinced me of something</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:46:06&gt; That was like an epiphany of the conversation partner thing</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:46:24&gt; Totally get &ldquo;stuff I believed and forgot&rdquo; this.</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:46:34&gt; :-)</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:47:23&gt; The network of small concept nodes with bidirectional links helps a lot getting to that old wisdom</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:47:28&gt; It&rsquo;s very abstract concept, I hope I overwhelmed myself 2 times. I hope I find a way to keep taking notes and don&rsquo;t feet unproductive.</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:47:55&gt; I tend to use gtd heavily</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:48:32&gt; I thinkg org is gateway drug for gtd and second brain.</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:48:32&gt; So, as long as I know my options and feel confident not doing what I&rsquo;m not doing, I&rsquo;m good with taking notes</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:49:22&gt; Otherwise, I just stop taking notes and feel also good then</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:50:11&gt; My second brain end up being a big bag of random unfinished thoughts, but in there, there definitely are useful stuff</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:50:59&gt; To me, gtd helps a lot renegotiating ones engagements and feel good with realizing I won&rsquo;t do this or that note after all</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:51:09&gt; That, and stoicism I guess</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:51:33&gt; Probably the reason I feel very bad is I don&rsquo;t read my notes again!</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:52:21&gt; Indeed, you might want to challenge the reason why you wrote them in that case</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:54:18&gt; I think making a habit of asking them for information is one key of a meaningful system</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:54:44&gt; And filling the lack of answer by a note answering the question</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:55:08&gt; This is definitely where I&rsquo;m going right now</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:55:42&gt; Epistemic modesty, then asking the system, then filling cache misses with consolidated notes</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:55:46&gt; What do you think about deleting part of notes? Do you delete often, for densening notes</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:55:46&gt; rinse and repeat</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:56:16&gt; I take a look at one random node a day</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:56:25&gt; If I feel so, I delete</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:56:40&gt; In general, I consolidate or just keep</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:56:57&gt; With 5K nodes, it still ok</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:57:08&gt; Very good to hear!</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:57:18&gt; To me, it&rsquo;s like a second brain</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:57:41&gt; A lot of useless junks and a few nuggets</li>
<li>eugercek:  22:57:52&gt; While I&rsquo;m transitioning org roam I&rsquo;ll delete and densen stuff.</li>
<li>konubinix:  22:58:07&gt; I guess the junks somehow help making the nuggets</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:00:46&gt; hmmm interesting convo</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:01:20&gt; konubinix: have you used Google Repo?</li>
<li>konubinix:  23:01:39&gt; My default choice is to leave junks. They do no harm and who knows whether they might prove valuable in the future?</li>
<li>konubinix:  23:01:49&gt; dcunit3d: No</li>
<li>konubinix:  23:02:13&gt; repo, as in the multi git tool that is used in android ?</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:02:18&gt; repo seems like it might be a heavy handed for the git flow that you mentioned in your blog <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo">https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo</a></li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:02:20&gt; yes</li>
<li>konubinix:  23:03:05&gt; Yes, once mike ten years ago</li>
<li>konubinix:  23:03:19&gt; Trying to build android from scratch</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:03:20&gt; i want to find a way to combine repo with orgit and org-roam, so i can get captures of snippets from git branches checked out via the default.xml</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:04:17&gt; but maybe orgit isn&rsquo;t what i&rsquo;m looking for, since it links to magit buffers. <a href="https://github.com/magit/orgit">https://github.com/magit/orgit</a></li>
<li>konubinix:  23:04:42&gt; Somehow, I never managed to like magit</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:05:16&gt; it would be nice to have a capture template that doesn&rsquo;t link to a currently checked out git repo, but instead links to a commit hash (+ metadata about git branch) that doesn&rsquo;t go stale. that way, i can capture code snippets and put them in org files</li>
<li>konubinix:  23:05:38&gt; You can create whatever links you want in org-mode</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:05:39&gt; i have a setup linked that allows me to do this, but the links go stale when files move.</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:06:42&gt; i mean i have a setup with using file linking that allows me to browse source like this. it works for multiple default.xml files in google repo</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  23:07:07&gt; i think my setup is a bit too heavy handed for most though.</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:06:21&gt; dcunit3d: I encourage you to look at the code of orgit to realize it is not a big deal to create org-mode links</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:06:51&gt; To me, your issue is ontological rather than technical. This is in my opinion the most difficult part</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:07:39&gt; Decide what needs to be done, that&rsquo;s to say in your case what would it be like to capture the link and to get back to it</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:07:52&gt; Then, I think you can craft something easily with org-store-link</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:08:34&gt; And of course, you will have to make assumptions about the environment in which the code is run, for a start you might want to assume repo is installed for instance</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:09:24&gt; To create the links to slack, it did not take me more than a few hours</li>
<li>konubinix:  09:09:31&gt; <a href="https://github.com/ag91/ol-emacs-slack">https://github.com/ag91/ol-emacs-slack</a></li>
<li>konubinix:  09:11:07&gt; The code is far from perfect, but I hope you get the idea</li>
<li>dcunit3d:  14:15:07&gt; thanks konubinix</li>
<li>buhtz:  16:07:52&gt; After an update of all packages at once I miss +FILETAG&rsquo;s in the right column of C-c n f search list like shown in this screen-recorded-GIF where you can see two entries with &ldquo;#Bib&rdquo; tag.</li>
<li>buhtz:  16:07:54&gt; <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11861496/153711862-b2ca2592-3f44-4d96-acea-af9de6f6a77b.gif" alt=""></li>
<li>buhtz 16:08:30:  does use ivy, ivy-rich and counsel and wonders which one of that or another package could be responsible for the tag column in the search result list</li>
