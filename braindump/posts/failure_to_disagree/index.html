<p>Simon (1992) offered a concise definition of skilled intuition that we both
endorse: “The situation has provided a cue: This cue has given the expert access
to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer.
Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition” (p. 155).</p>

<p>There is no subjective marker that distinguishes correct intuitions from
intuitions that are produced by highly imperfect heuristics. An important
characteristic of intuitive judgments, which they share with perceptual
impressions, is that a single response initially comes to mind. Most of the time
we have to trust this first impulse, and most of the time we are right or are
able to make the necessary corrections if we turn out to be wrong, but high
