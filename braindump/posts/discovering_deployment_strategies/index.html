</ul>
<p>Before getting head first into a shinny geeky deployment method, one is advised
to beware the <a href="/braindump/posts/charge_mentale/">cognitive load</a> of people that will work with it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Also, it is
good practice to accompany those with some monitoring to ensure the deployment
did not induce regressions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Deployment may be run either manually, or automatically. In the later case, we
will call it <a href="/braindump/posts/deployment_vocabulary/#fa32d48f-1529-4295-b3b7-9625c06a2c80">continuous deployment</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When deploying resources, you can either deploy everything at once, or do it
incrementally.</p>
<p>The known strategies to deploy everything at once are:</p>
<ol>
<li>recreate: you shut the old resources down and start the new ones<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>,</li>
<li>big bang: you start the new resources and shut the old resources down<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>,</li>
<li>blue/green: you start everything in a (green) environment beside the
production (blue), test this new deployment and if reach your expectation
switch all the traffic to the new
one<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. This implies some data structure
compatibility between the old and the new version<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Incremental deployments supposedly allow a more Zen approach, where you can more
easily observe the deployment process and rollback if need be<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, while
having no down time<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. On the other hand, that requires a way to deal with
the continuity of the user experience<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is unclear to me whether rolling deployment is the same as incremental
deployment. In the articles I read, I could see rolling deployment as described
to be about increasing gradually<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> the number of users<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>,
servers<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, nodes<sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> or applications<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the case of rolling the servers, people call it
ramped<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Actually, I also often see rolling as describing ramped
deployments<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, while canary is used to describe rolling at the application
level<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of deployments that are not to upgrade the stack per se:
<a href="/braindump/posts/deployment_vocabulary/#8a803877-df22-4746-87ee-f58ed955d64c">shadow deployment</a> and A/B testing. The former uses a &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; environment that
will get a copy of user requests<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> and whose responses will never be
sent back to the user<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. It helps monitoring how it behaves before deciding
to validate a release or not<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The later temporary redirect the
traffic of a subset of users to an alternative version of a feature to find out
how they behave<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Those two kinds of deployment are about measuring
stuff before actually upgrading anything.</p>
<p>When you want a finer grain about the dynamic of the upgrade, you can deploy the
new version aside the current one<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> and incrementally redirect users to
it<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. That way, you can monitor how things happen before adding more
users. This most likely use similar tooling than A/B testing, but the aim is
here to upgrade the stack, not just monitor user behaviors<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. This is
particularly useful if you feel like something may go wrong and don&rsquo;t want to
impact everyone at once<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Therefore, you may want to spot a
particular subset of users that will expect cutting edge stuffs that might
become unstable from time to time<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. If on the other end, you feel
confident with the upgrade, a blue/green deployment is likely more
suited<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. Also, to provide a consistent user experience, you need to deal
with sticky sessions here.</p>
<p>Now, if you want even finer grain on what the end users will be able to see,
consider adopting <a href="/braindump/posts/trunk_based_development/">trunk based development</a>, in which features are hidden
behind feature flags. You can test the latest version (with all flags turn on)
and the production version (with only the production flags turned on) and deploy
often<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Because you deploy the artifacts in disabled state, there is less
fear of stuff going wrong and incrementally deploying becomes less needed. The
incremental upgrade can be done at the level you want<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. You can even
imagine a user sending a particular header to ask for the new version of a
feature<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. The aim is still to enable all the flags, but this can be done much
smoother<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. You can implement the blue/green, A/B testing and canary
deployments using features flags<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>, more easily than trying to do it at the network and session layers<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. On the other hand, it
requires a big amount of work beforehand to test the code appropriately and to
have a team doing trunk based development.</p>

<p>There appears to be no ideal deployment method. If you have a bunch of users
using the application frequently and you can &ldquo;test&rdquo; the user experience on a
few users, a canary might be a good candidate.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the application is very seldom used, a canary might be
too long (because of the long feedback loop) and a simple recreate might be
enough.</p>
<p>Doing canary also comes with the rabbit hole of sticky sessions.</p>
<p>Also, you have to possibly replicate user behavior from the old to the new
infrastructure so that when a user is transitioned to the new environment,
everything that was done in the previous one is kept.</p>
<p>blue/green lacks the possibility to incrementally upgrade and the comfort of a
feedback loop that comes with it, but it does not comes with the sticky
session hell. Like canary, it needs a way to &ldquo;copy&rdquo; the user data from blue to
green dynamically so that the transition goes well.</p>
<p>recreate implies user downtime, but it does not have the issue of playing with
several deployments.</p>
<p>If you want more power over the upgrade, <a href="/braindump/posts/trunk_based_development/">trunk based development</a> might
help, but it require much effort (technical, but mostly psychological) to be
put in place.</p>
<p>In conclusion, no deployment is to be advised for all situations, your mileage
may vary<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. They all have a kind of Zen attitude on some dimension and are hard
to deal with on other dimensions.</p>
<p>Prior to deciding what deployment method is well suited for your use case, you
definitely need:</p>
<ol>
<li>have to a good monitoring to guess the user behavior,</li>
<li>a good idea of the code change to find out how hellish will be keeping two
environments side by side,</li>

<p>original concept of DevOps, release came before the deployment process within
the software development and release cycle. A release consisted of freezing
code, after it had undergone testing and validation in the staging
environment, and marking it ready for deployment to production. The
application deployment was the process of moving this code to a production
environment, thereby making it live.</p>
<p>The introduction of feature flags changed this. In a modern DevOps process,
deployment now comes before release. This is because feature flags decouple
the deploy from the release. Even though code is deployed to production, the
code may not be running. Users will see the old version until the new version
of the application is enabled. Strategies like trunk-based development,
whereby code is constantly merged into the main branch, combined with
continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) mean that new code is
constantly being pushed to a production environment. However, it is only when
the relevant feature flag is enabled, that the new features are actually
released.</p>
<p>This also means that release doesn&rsquo;t encompass the entire application code,
but can be thought of on a feature-by-feature basis.</p>

<p>using feature flags it is possible to replicate a blue/green deployment
strategy without requiring duplicate environments. The green deployment code
would be deployed to the standard production environment but hidden behind a
feature flag. The new functionality would only be visible to the internal
testing team via targeting and, once the release has been validated, the
flag would be turned on for all users.</p>

<p>Feature flags alter the equation when it comes to rolling or incremental releases because they become relatively trivial to manage</p>

<p>Here are some scenarios where using feature flags make more sense than blue/green deployments. Like everything else in software, it’s about trade-offs,</p>
