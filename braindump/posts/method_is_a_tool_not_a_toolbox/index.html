        <h1>Method Is a Tool, Not a Toolbox</h1>
		<span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><a href="/braindump/tags/fleeting/">Fleeting</a></span></p>
        <p><a href="/braindump/posts/method/">method</a> is a tool, not a toolbox</p>
<p>Recently, I was having a <a href="/braindump/posts/debat_semantique/">semantic debate</a> whether or not we use a method. It got
into whether or not it is useful to <a href="/braindump/posts/cherry_picking/">cherry pick</a> only pick this or that part
of the method.</p>
<p>I was told the following analogy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A method is like a toolbox. You can pick whatever tool you need from it,
without needing to pick all the tools. You can use the hammer, or the
screwdriver, or the saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me, in addition to introduce a <false dilemma><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that I won&rsquo;t develop
here, this analogy is not accurate.</p>
<p>It suggests that whoever created the method did not think of it as a whole, but
as separate parts independent of each other.</p>
<p>I assume that this might be true in some methods, but in the ones I have
investigated, such as <a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/">gtd</a> or <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a>, there are a lot of connection
between the elements of the method.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily scrum</a> is strongly related to the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_goal/">sprint goal</a>, the <a href="/braindump/posts/sprint_backlog/">sprint
backlog</a>, which themselves are strongly related to the notion of
<a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#99fecbee-b369-4e6d-9292-f9a566a8e028">sprint</a>. Also, it relies on two of the three <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/">pillars of scrum</a>: <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#inspection">inspection
(scrum)</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/three_pillars_of_scrum/#adaptation">adaptation (scrum)</a>.</p>
<p>To my mind, simply picking the idea of having a conversation on the morning and
discussing whatever we are working on is not at all picking the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum_events/#1929f6bc-7e50-4377-a57a-ae2805d63171">daily scrum</a>
tool from the <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a> toolbox. It is rather using the same word to do
something quite different.</p>
<p>Therefore, in that analogy, I would suggest that a method is not a toolbox with
independent tools, but rather a tool, with several connected parts. Using only a
part lose some of the intent of the method.</p>
<p>My phrasing of this analogy is then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A method is like a tool. It has been made to fulfil a purpose and is composed
of very connected parts. You can try to use the part separately, but you will
likely lose some of its interest&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can imagine that in some methods, you can follow the connection and see not
only one whole tools, but a few of them with weak connection between them. I
think it needs a deeper understanding of the method to be able to extract all
the parts that come together and still taking advantage of the method.</p>
<p>Also, at least in <a href="/braindump/posts/scrum/">scrum</a> and <a href="/braindump/posts/getting_things_done/">gtd</a>, I feel like those methods have evolved with
time, trying to remove the extra parts that were not essential (<a href="/braindump/posts/lean/">lean</a>). The
current state of the method is still evolving, but is likely to contain only a
kernel of strongly related components. This reinforces my <a href="/braindump/posts/belief_system/">belief</a> that it is
highly probable that it makes little sense to use only a part of the method and
claim reaching its objective.</p>
<p>To be noted that sometimes, the claimed objective of the method and your
objective might differ. In that case, it sounds perfectly reasonable to create
your own method and picking into the part of other method as inspiration. But in
that case, it would be <a href="/braindump/posts/intellectually_honest/">intellectually dishonest</a> to pretend applying the
method and reaching the same objective.</p>
