<p>paradoxe of the dichotomy of control . you better realize on what you really have control and therefore you feel more in control</p>

<li>during the day, feel the present time (<a href="/braindump/posts/stoic_mindfulness/">stoic mindfulness</a>). Be conscious of what happens around you. Don&rsquo;t use headphones or stuff like that to flee from what happens
<ul>
<li>remember that things happen (not in your control) and you can decide how you react (in your control) -&gt; <a href="/braindump/posts/modele_de_brooke_castillo/#fb99b436-3b29-467b-a7de-a9a1079aa6d0">métaphore de la boite d&rsquo;allumettes</a></li>

<li>evening, note in a journal
<ul>
<li>what did I do right? -&gt; tap yourself in the back for that</li>
<li>what could I do better? -&gt; learn from that</li>
<li>what didn&rsquo;t I do and should have done?</li>
<li>your are not perfect. tomorrow will be another day and you will be more equipped because you will have learned from today</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of those seems to be historical stoic concept that have been merged into common wisdom.</p>
<p>At the time when the church competed with philosophies as major though system,
they decided to ridiculed <a href="/braindump/posts/epicurisme/">epicurism</a> (making it the synonym of <a href="/braindump/posts/drug_sex_food_and_rock_n_roll/">drug sex food and
rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll</a>) and absorbed stoicism.</p>
<p>This make sense, because epicurism metaphysics suppose that things happen
randomly while the stoic one suppose that things happen for a reason and this is
compatible with the idea of God. Yet, modern stoicism can rationalize this idea
of things that happen for some reason with the idea of the laws of the universe
and still keep God out of this.</p>
<p>epicurism is deist, but assumes that gods don&rsquo;t care about us while stoicism is
theist and suppose that gods care about us.</p>
<p><a href="/braindump/posts/dichotomy_of_control_may_lead_to_some_form_of_fatalism/">dichotomy of control may lead to some form of fatalism</a>. You can say, well I
don&rsquo;t have the control, so why bother? This is a common misconception of
stoicism, along with thinking that stoicism are emotionless people.</p>
<p>On the contrary, stoicism is guided by love of other beings (therefore, it also
encourages vegetarianism). If something bothers you and you can do something
about it, you have the moral obligation to do whatever you can do to make it
right. Focus on what you have control on and don&rsquo;t bother with what is out of
your control like the outcome (<a href="/braindump/posts/metaphore_de_l_archer/">métaphore de l&rsquo;archer</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, it has a fine model of emotion. There are reactive emotions that are
out of your control and active emotion that you decide to have afterwards. It
suggest to accept the former and focus on the latter to make things right,
according to your values (<a href="/braindump/posts/intuitions_come_first_strategic_reasoning_second/">intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second</a>).</p>
<p>It is reminded that most famous stoicist where people known for their power to
change things.</p>
<p>Stoicism is about stopping to have <a href="/braindump/posts/emotion_moteur/">émotion =&gt; moteur</a> and focus on <a href="/braindump/posts/valeurs_moteur/">valeurs =&gt; moteur</a>.</p>
<p>dichotomy of control is not about feeling good about stuff not in your control
but rather accepting it and moving forward.</p>
<p>Some quotes, out of the context, might lead to think that stoicist sometimes
disagree. It looks like they globally agree (<a href="/braindump/posts/interpretation_la_plus_charitable/">interprétation la plus charitable</a>),
but because this is an idea that thrived for almost 500 years and a lot of stuff
got from there, it is almost obvious that some quotes will contradict in there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t focus on the past because you cannot change it. Don&rsquo;t focus in the far
future because it is too uncertain. Focus on now and the near future because
this is your horizon of control (<a href="/braindump/posts/fail_fast_and_often/">fail fast and often</a>, <a href="/braindump/posts/rapid_application_development/">Rapid Application Development</a>)</p>
