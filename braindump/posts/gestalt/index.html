<p>Gestalt psychology, gestaltism or configurationism is a school of psychology
that emerged in the early twentieth century in Austria and Germany as a theory
of perception that was a rejection to the basic principles of Wilhelm Wundt&rsquo;s
and Edward Titchener&rsquo;s elementalist and structuralist psychology.</p>

<p>External reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles
in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the
observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and
objects, a principle known as Prägnanz. Gestalt psychologists argued that these
principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns
in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five
categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Gestalt law of proximity states that &ldquo;objects or shapes that are close to
one another appear to form groups&rdquo;. Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are
radically different, they will appear as a group if they are close.</p>

<h2 id="ae8278aa-ba7e-4196-917a-c0561de0a75b">law of proximity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of
objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a
group. For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are
72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups. Specifically,
we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image
and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image. This law is often
used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are
associated.[36][40]</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="b92592dd-184b-44ae-ab1b-5cbfa6731a61">law of similarity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are
perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other. This similarity
can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities. For example,
the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal
distance apart from one another forming a square. In this depiction, 18 of the
circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light. We perceive the
dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together,
forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of
lines is due to the law of similarity.[40]</p>

<h2 id="9b4fa057-4238-4bb7-a9da-aeb585f273ad">law of closure</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Gestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete
rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain.[41] For example,
a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completeness. However, we will also
perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circle.[32] That tendency to
complete shapes and figures is called closure.[32] The law of closure states
that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as
being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole
picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that
the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through
sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the
figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on
the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the
image. However, gaps are present in the shapes. If the law of closure did not
exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different
lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually
combine the lines into whole shapes.[36][40][42]</p>

<h2 id="f1692b55-d0a0-42de-945d-c67272f9c2d2">law of symmetry</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical
and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects
into an even number of symmetrical parts. Therefore, when two symmetrical
elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent
shape. Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that
objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the
figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled
brackets. When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of
symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.[36][40]</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="15f3a01d-49ff-457d-95d2-9c69869e6bc6">law of common fate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move
along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found
that the movement of elements of an object produces paths that individuals
perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends
of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity
implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and
are therefore on the same path. For example, if there are an array of dots and
half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we
would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two
distinct units.[34]</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="d74905fc-da50-492f-b778-53f2b1f1d14b">law of continuity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that
elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into
perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object. In cases where there is
an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as
two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap. We
are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being
one object. For example, the figure depicting the law of continuity shows a
configuration of two crossed keys. When the image is perceived, we tend to
perceive the key in the background as a single uninterrupted key instead of two
separate halves of a key.[36]</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="ef7942bb-ec00-4d3c-8926-b6d225147f26">law of past experience</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli
are categorized according to past experience. If two objects tend to be observed
within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely
to be perceived together. For example, the English language contains 26 letters
that are grouped to form words using a set of rules. If an individual reads an
English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to
interpret the letters &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; as two letters beside each other, rather than
using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an
uppercase U.[34]</p>
